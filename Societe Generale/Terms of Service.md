E\&S sector policy | Oil \& Gas | 3



1. INTRODUCTION



In the frame of its corporate social responsibility policy, and as a signatory of the Principles for Responsible Banking, the

Group (as defined in 2.2 of this sector policy) intends to take into account the environmental, social (E\&S) and governance

issues associated with all its activities, to better control its impact and promote good practices, with an objective of

continuous improvement. The Group published E\&S general principles which define the overall framework of its E\&S risk

management system for the responsible conduct of its banking and financial activities. Within this framework, transversal

statements addressing issues common to all sectors have been developed, as well as sector policies where the Group looks

more specifically into certain sectors identified as sensitive from an E\&S standpoint and in which it plays an active role.



The Oil \& Gas sector has been identified as one such sector.



The Group provides a range of banking and financial products and services to the Oil \& Gas sector, which is part of the

Energy sector value chain. Energy sector Group policies seek to identify and manage E\&S issues throughout the whole

value chain in which Societe Generale is active from the extraction of energy resources to transportation, distribution and

storage, power and heat production, and end user energy consumption. In a process of continuous improvement, the

Group regularly identifies and develops complementary sectoral policies to better address E\&S issues within this value

chain.



Energy is at the core of the economy and the energy transition, and more broadly the achievement of the objectives of the

Paris Agreement, are major transformation challenges for this sector. The Group recognizes it has a role to play in the

transition to a low-carbon economy and supports governments and private sector efforts towards the diversification of

energy sources and wider use of renewable energy. The Group has joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance1 which defines

concrete and time-bound actions to align portfolios with a trajectory compatible with the Paris Agreement. Societe

Generale was one of the first global banks to commit in 2020 to a short-term objective of reducing its exposure to the oil

and gas production sector (by 10% in 2025 vs. 2019) and has since then revised its ambitions upwards.



In September 2023, Societe Generale set new objectives :

- acceleration of the reduction of upstream Oil \& Gas exposure to -80% by 2030 vs 2019, with an intermediary 2025

step of -50% (vs previous commitment of -20% by 2025);

- a new objective to reduce by 70% the absolute GHG financed emissions linked to the oil and gas portfolio by 2030

(compared to 2019) to now cover the entire value chain on scope 1 and 2 and scope 3 linked to the end-use of oil

and gas production.



Societe Generale is willing to remain a value-adding partner to its Oil and Gas clients engaged into the energy transition of

the economy. Oil and gas activities may take place in complex operating environments, remote locations and countries

with weak governance systems. They may also impact local communities and require heightened E\&S risk management

and due diligence. This is why the Group aims for the highest E\&S standards when considering the provision of banking

and financial products and services to the Oil and Gas industry.

3. OIL \& GAS SECTOR ESG RISKS



A non-exhaustive list of potential E\&S and governance risks considered by Societe Generale in its risk management

framework is provided in the E\&S general principles.



When evaluating corporates’ activity in the Oil \& Gas sector, particular attention will be paid to the following risks:

• Impacts on natural habitats, and areas protected for biodiversity or cultural considerations.

• Increased access to previously remote areas (which can result in impacts by third parties such as clearance of

forest, or conflict with local communities).

• Air emissions and carbon intensity of the production.

• Reliance on gas flaring as a management strategy for associated gases.

• Methane leakages.

• Water consumption for processing and cooling operations, with potential negative impacts on water flow and/or

quality.

• Potential for pollution of ground and surface water.

• Wastewater management.

• Waste management, including discharge of offshore drilling waste.

• Oil spill risks.

• Impact of toxic chemicals.

• Fire and explosion risks.

• Poor health and safety management for workers.

• Increased health and safety risks for local communities.

• Impacts on local communities, including resettlement or economic displacement caused by loss of land or assets.

• Impacts on indigenous peoples or lands used by indigenous peoples.

• Operations in areas of conflicts with communities and/or deployment of armed forces for security purposes.

• Operations in areas where there is a legacy of tension and in countries with a history of weak regulatory

frameworks, lack of transparency or high corruption and/or human rights violations.

• Displacement of food crops and potential impact on the food and feed market prices (biofuels).



In addition, governance risks are managed as part of the Know Your Customer (KYC) and other Compliance processes to

guarantee alignment of the Group with applicable laws and regulations, including exclusions based on international

sanctions.



4. SECTOR SPECIFIC E\&S STANDARDS AND INITIATIVES



The Group requests its clients to comply at a minimum with the E\&S laws and regulations of each relevant country or region

in which they operate while encouraging them to apply the following E\&S standards and initiatives.

E\&S sector policy | Oil \& Gas | 6



A number of institutions, business associations of the Oil \& Gas industry, and other civil society organizations have

developed standards and initiatives addressing the E\&S impacts resulting from the Oil and Gas sector. The standards and

initiatives listed below provide guidance for Societe Generale E\&S assessment framework in the Oil \& Gas sector:



• E\&S management

o the IFC Performance Standards and World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines

applicable to the Oil \& Gas sector.

o the International Energy Agency Golden Rules for a Golden Age of Gas (2012).

o the good practice guidance of the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation

Association (IPIECA) and of the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP).

• Climate impact

o the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI).

o the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership.

o the CDP Climate Change Program.

o the European Union Fuel Quality Directive 2009/30/EC.

• Human Rights - the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (2000), the UN Declaration on the Rights

of Indigenous People (2008)

• Transparency - the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).

• Gas Flaring - the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) and the Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 led by the

World Bank.

• Emergency Response - For maritime operations, the IMO Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response

and Co-operation (OPRC, 1990).

• Marine Pollution - the 2003 amendment to Annex 1 of the International Convention for the Prevention of

Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) concerning the prevention of pollution by oil, and remaining criteria of the

MARPOL Convention when applicable. The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-

East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention).

New regulations and voluntary standards are regularly developed. The Group will closely follow these developments, use

them as references in implementing its Oil \& Gas sector policy and update it if necessary.



5. IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS AND CLIENT ENGAGEMENT



5.1. Implementation process



While it is incumbent on the Group’s clients to manage the E\&S risks associated with their operations and to comply with

the applicable E\&S laws and regulations, the Group evaluates, for its part, the consistency of their activities with the

Group’s E\&S commitments.



The Group’s E\&S general principles set out the main features and implementation processes of the Group’s E\&S risk

management system. The Group’s decisions are based on public information, information made available by its clients or

from external data providers. The Group shall make its reasonable endeavors to ensure the quality and reliability of this

information but accepts no liability whatsoever in connection with any such information.

E\&S sector policy | Oil \& Gas | 7



As part of the implementation of the sector policy, three types of application criteria have been defined:



The E\&S evaluation criteria are applicable in a proportionate manner based on the importance of the E\&S risks inherent to

the clients' activities and to the underlying activities related to dedicated transactions, products and services.



5.2. Client engagement



The results of the evaluation regarding the different criteria will provide evidence for decision-making process to the

Group. The Group will work with clients within the implementation scope who meet or aim at meeting the applicable E\&S

criteria.



In the specific case of clients operating in the upstream segment of the Oil \& Gas value chain, with the exception of

clients excluded under section 6.1:

The Group will continue to propose banking and financial products and services to these clients but will be attentive to

their objectives and investments to move towards a low-carbon economy through reinforced commitment criteria. The

Group will conduct an annual review of these clients' climate strategies, informing a committee of the Societe Generale

group, under the chairmanship of the senior management and it may include:

▪ client carbon footprint

▪ climate commitments

▪ diversification of its activities

▪ the resources deployed such as R\&D and the level of investments devoted to activities in support of the

energy transition

▪ the governance put in place to implement the climate objectives



The Group may refuse to provide banking or financial products or services to certain corporates or refuse to be involved in

certain transactions as a result of this evaluation, even if the exclusion criteria defined in this sector policy are not

applicable. The Group may also require additional actions or engage in an additional due diligence process before

concluding on the acceptability of a client or a transaction.



Any deviation from this policy may be granted, on an exceptional basis, by a Societe Generale group oversight committee

chaired by senior management.



The E\&S exclusion criteria are criteria on the basis of which are excluded from the Group’s activities some corporates,

some dedicated transactions or some financial products and services.



The E\&S priority evaluation criteria are criteria for which an analysis is requested as part of the evaluation process.

For client’s evaluation, if the relevant criteria are not fulfilled, a positive evolution from the company current practices

is expected in a limited and reasonable timeframe and can be formalized through action plans or contract clauses. For

transactions on dedicated projects, alignment with the criteria is expected as part of the project development. For

dedicated advisory services ahead of a project’s development, the client’s commitment to develop the project

according to these criteria is evaluated.



The other E\&S evaluation criteria aim to identify the other risk factors of the sector, that will also be considered as

part of the evaluation, and also to specify the best practices that the Group wishes to encourage.

E\&S sector policy | Oil \& Gas | 8



6. APPLICATION CRITERIA OF THE POLICY



Based on the analysis of the initiatives listed in Section 4. and of best practices of multilaterals and other financial

institutions, the Group has defined the following E\&S criteria which are incorporated into its decision-making process

o Oil sands or other extra heavy oil,

o Shale oil or gas.



In the specific case of Companies7 generating almost all of their revenues from upstream Oil and Gas activities (i.e.

exploration, development and production), the 30% threshold will be applied to their production8.



• any private Company9 (ie. not majority-owned by a state), which generates almost all of its revenues from

upstream Oil and Gas activities (i.e. exploration, development and production). Existing exposure will be phased

out until extinction, in compliance with existing contracts.



Evaluation priority criteria



When conducting a corporate E\&S assessment of a client owning, developing or operating assets in this Oil and Gas sector,

the Group considers the following criteria:

• Whether the client company has E\&S risks management measures in place, commensurate to its impacts, and

addressing in particular:

o Health and safety.

7. APPLICATION DATE AND UPDATES



This sector policy is applicable from the date of its publication, with exceptions for pre-existing business commitments or

opportunities at an advanced stage of negotiation.



This sector policy may evolve in time, in accordance notably with legislative or regulatory evolutions and as a result of the

discussions between the Group and its various stakeholders. Therefore, the Group reserves the right to modify this sector

policy at any time. Updated versions will be posted on the Group’s website, where the E\&S general principles and the E\&S

transversal statements and other sector policies are also available.



This sector policy has been established in French and in English. In case of inconsistency between the French and the

English version, the French version shall prevail.

E\&S sector policy | Oil \& Gas | 12



8. GLOSSARY



• Arctic region: For the sake of this policy, the Arctic region is defined as the following:

Offshore areas: “Arctic waters” as defined in the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea (regulation XIV/1.3) and the

International Maritime Organization (IMO) Polar Code (see map p 9 of Annex 10).

Onshore areas: North of the Arctic Circle (north of 66°33′47.2′′ N)



• Company: refers to the legal entity and companies in its scope of consolidation. Consequently, for the calculation of

the indicators in this policy for a Company, reference must be made to its consolidated financial statements.



• Extra heavy oil is commonly defined as oil with an API gravity of less than 10°.



• First Generation Biofuels are biofuels produced from food crops by converting the sugar, starch or oil content

into bioethanol or biodiesel.



• Flaring is the open-air burning of natural gas.



• Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC): There is no universally accepted definition of FPIC. Based on good

faith negotiation between the client and affected indigenous communities, FPIC builds on and expands the

process of Informed Consultation and Participation, ensures the meaningful participation of Indigenous Peoples

in decision-making, and focuses on achieving agreement. FPIC does not require unanimity, does not confer veto

rights to individuals or sub-groups, and does not require the client to agree to aspects not under their control.

Process elements to achieve FPIC are found in IFC Performance Standard 7.



• Golden rules: In 2012, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Golden Rules for a Golden Age of Gas, a

special report that proposes key principles to address the environmental and social impacts of intensive large

scale onshore unconventional gas development in order to pave the way for its widespread development on a

large scale. The IEA “Golden Rules” underline the importance of transparency, measuring and monitoring of

environmental impacts and engagement with local communities.



• Midstream Infrastructures Associated to: For the sake of this policy, infrastructures (pipelines, storage,

liquefaction and export terminals of oil, natural gas or LNG) whose viability and existence depend in majority on

the development of Greenfield oil and gas fields upstream activities



• Oil sands: Also known as tar sands or crude bitumen, oil sands are either loose sands or partially consolidated

sandstone comprising a naturally occurring mixture of sand, clay and water, saturated with a dense and viscous

form of petroleum (viscosity is \>10,000 cp and API <10 degrees). They require heat, dilution or other tertiary

processes for recovery.



• Routine flaring is flaring during normal oil production operations in the absence of sufficient facilities or

amenable geology to re-inject the produced gas, utilize it on-site, or dispatch it to a market. (Source: Global Gas

Flaring Reduction Partnership)



• Shale oil and shale gas are oil and gas resources trapped within shale formations. Their extraction frequently

entails intensive large-scale developments including specific hydraulic fracturing techniques.



• Venting is the release of natural gas directly into the atmosphere without flaring or incineration.
