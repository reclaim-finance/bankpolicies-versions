



As a general insurance and reinsurance company, QBE’s purpose is to enable a more resilient

future. We continue to integrate sustainability across our business, in support of our purpose.



Our commitments



QBE’s Environmental and Social (E\&S) Risk Framework

outlines the minimum criteria to which we are

committed as a business with respect to human rights

and the environment for our investment and

underwriting business.



All actions taken will be in strict compliance with

applicable laws and regulations and this requirement

will override all other underwriting assessment

decisions. Without limiting this, all actions and

underwriting decisions for customers in the United

States will be based on an ordinary insurance business

purpose, which may include the application of sound

actuarial risk and underwriting principles.



Scope



Conditions apply as set out in this scope section. QBE

reserves the right to change the E\&S Risk Framework.

Investments

The E\&S Risk Framework applies to direct investments.

It does not apply to: indirect investments (i.e., when

QBE does not have discretion to determine the

underlying investment exposures, such as ETFs and

unlisted funds); derivatives including foreign exchange;

cash and money market securities; direct property;

semi-government; sovereign; exchange traded

commodities; and asset backed securities.



Underwriting

The E\&S Risk Framework applies to QBE’s own

deŋnitions and criteria at the time of release of a

bindable quotation.

The E\&S Risk Framework is applied to relevant

facultative product lines and direct insurance where

QBE knowingly and directly underwrites, prices,

quotes, and issues a contract directly to the customer,

rather than through third-party distributors or

coverholders. The E\&S Risk Framework may not apply

to, among others: treaty reinsurances business;

compulsory / statutory classes of business (such as

worker’s compensation or third-party motor);

personal injury insurance (such as accident \& health,

travel); insurances oŏered through Federal Crop

Insurance Program or similar; Joint Venture business;

where QBE may be indirectly exposed (have no direct

contractual relationship) to a company including their

subsidiaries; where related to services (e.g.

contractors, sub-contractors, labour hire companies,

ancillary services); or decommissioning fossil fuel

activities.

Revenue is deŋned as the gross annual revenue

evaluated at a parent company level unless stated

otherwise in the sensitive sector position.



Environmental and Social Risk Framework



Effective date: 1 January 2026



Version 1.3

Sensitive sectors

Biodiversity and protected areas



Protected areas, such as World Heritage Sites, are

recognised for their global environmental and cultural

significance and/or biological diversity, and for the

important economic, social and environmental

benefits they provide to people. These sites deliver

critical environmental services such as stabilising soils,

preventing floods and capturing carbon, all of which

increase our resilience to the most harmful impacts of

a warming climate. QBE also recognises the

importance of cultural heritage for current and future

generations and seeks to protect areas of significant

cultural heritage and value from the adverse impacts

of project activities. QBE recognises that customer

activities may have material impacts on protected

areas that could substantially harm the biodiversity

and cultural value of these sites.

QBE will not knowingly and directly provide project-

specific insurance in severe risk sectors (oil and gas,

mining and large-scale hydropower dams that

generate greater than 20 MW of electricity) located in

natural or mixed World Heritage Sites or their buffer

zone, unless there is a prior permit issued by

Government and no UNESCO objections have been

raised publicly at the time of underwriting.

For projects in high risk sectors (logging, commercial

ŋshing, agriculture, plantations and large-scale

infrastructure such as pipelines, roads and mega-

ports) located in natural and mixed World Heritage

Sites or their buŏer zone, QBE will consider potential

impacts on the World Heritage Site, taking into

account criteria recommended by UNESCO, including

any mitigations to limit the risks associated with

potential impacts when making an underwriting

decision.



Fishing



Pirate, or illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a

significant environmental risk as it contributes to

overfishing and the destruction of vital marine habitats

and ecosystems. Such activity may also be linked to

increased claims, fraud and other crimes.

QBE will not knowingly insure or facilitate the marine

insurance of vessels that are blacklisted on the Illegal,

Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing Vessel List for

pirate fishing.



Forestry, mining, large-scale

hydropower dams, and mining



QBE recognises there are concerns with projects

associated with negative environmental impacts on

the ecological systems in which a project is

constructed and connected to, as well as social

impacts on the surrounding communities.

For projects associated with primary activities of

forestry (logging), large-scale hydropower dams that

generate greater than 20 MW of electricity, and

mining, where QBE knowingly and directly provides

project-specific insurance, ourdue diligence approach

considers the following:



 Environmental and social impact assessments;

 Health, safety and environment plans; and

 Any significant local opposition or controversies.

Defence

Firearms



We will not knowingly and directly insure or directly invest

in:

 Any existing or new insurance customer or company

which sells and/or manufactures firearms or

ammunition, where revenue from the manufacture

and/or sales of firearms or ammunition represents

more than 30% of revenue of the insured customer

or company (regardless of its position in the

corporate structure); or

 Any corporate entity or political organisation which

has as its principal activity or purpose of conducting

or in any way promoting activities involving the use

offirearmstoharm orkillpeople,or to carry out other

intentional acts of wrongdoing.

Exemptions:

Companies that meet one or several of the below criteria

are exempt:

 Sold and/or manufactured for the exclusive use of the

military orsecurity forces of a country not prohibited

by sanctions laws;

 Usedbythemilitaryorsecurityforces,or a legitimate

nationalorstate law enforcement agency, of acountry

not prohibited by sanctions laws;

 Used by a legitimate bodyguarding or security

operation that has received enhanced underwriting

scrutinyinaccordancewithQBEinternalprocedures;

 Sports shooting clubs that are primarily used as

sports training facilities or associations; or

 Used in connection with the rescue of individuals in

any territory covered by a valid Kidnap and Ransom

policy issued by QBE.



Controversial weapons



QBE is concerned with the indiscriminate and

disproportionate harm caused by specific weapons and

weapon systems on humans and the environment. The

E\&S Risk Framework applies to the development,

production or sale of controversial weapons.

Controversial weapons are defined as:

 Cluster weapons;

 Anti-personnel mines (landmines);

 Biological weapons;

 Chemical weapons;

 Weapons carrying depleted uranium; and

 Nuclear weapons.



QBE willnotknowinglyanddirectly insure or directly invest

in companies currently involved in the:

 Development, production, or sale of controversial

weapons;

 Development, production, or sale of nuclear

weapons, unless they are produced for the benefit of

the armed forces of a nuclear-weapon state

according to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of

Nuclear Weapons of 1 July 1968; or

 Production of arms in countries prohibited by

sanctions laws.

Energy

Coal



QBE will:

 Not directly invest in companies that derive more

than 5% of revenue from thermal coal;

 Not directly invest in utility companies that

generate or have the capacity to generate more

than 5% of their power from thermal coal;

 Not provide any new direct insurance services for

new construction projects for thermal coal mines

or power stations or thermal coal transport

infrastructure; and

 Phase out all direct insurance services for

companies that derive more than 30% of revenue

and/or power generation from thermal coal by 1

January 2030.

QBE will continue to invest in and provide insurance for

metallurgical (or coking) coal companies. There are

currently no industrial-scale alternatives to metallurgical

coal for the manufacture of steel, which is vital for future

economic development and for the construction of

renewable energy assets.



Conventional oil and gas, oil sands and

Arctic drilling



QBE recognises that the oil and gas industry is

responding to the challenge of transitioning to a lower

carbon future. We will continue to work closely with our

customers to support them through developing risk

management and insurance solutions for new

technologies needed for transition.



Investments



 QBE will not directly invest in companies which derive

more than 30% of their revenue from oil and gas

(upstream, midstream, and downstream).

 QBE will not directly invest in utility companies that

generate or have the capacity to generate more than

30% of their power from oil and gas.

 QBE will not directly invest in companies that derive

more than 5% of revenue from the extraction or

production of oil sands and/or Arctic drilling.



Underwriting

 QBE will not provide insurance for construction of

new oil sands extraction projects.

 QBE will assess the transition maturity of in-scope

customers who we knowingly and directly insure.

Where:

(i) QBE defines in-scope customers as:

a. Oil and gas customers who generate

\>60% or more revenue from oil and gas

extraction. This threshold will be reduced

to \>30% from 1 January 2040.

b. Customers who generate \>30% revenue

from oil sands and Arctic drilling.

(ii) Oil and gas extraction, oil sands extraction,

Arctic drilling is defined as companies

undertaking the direct exploration, extraction

and drilling for oil and gas. This does not apply

to consultants undertaking these activities.

QBE will commence roll-out of the customer transition

maturity assessment process from 1 January 2026. Our

assessment will consider customers’ emissions

performance and where relevant, additional factors such

as decarbonisation goals. QBE expects that the

transition maturity assessment will evolve over time in

line with emerging best practice and learnings from our

implementation.



QBE will engage with customers assessed as low

transition maturity and/or their brokers. QBE will

reassess these customers on an annual basis. If after 3

years the customer continues to be assessed as low

maturity, then QBE will consider if there are any

justifications for the customer’s position and decide

whether to decline or to continue to provide insurance

services to that customer.
