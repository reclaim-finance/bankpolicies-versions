Based on these overarchingcommitments on human rights and the environment,the E\&S Risk Framework specifies detailed commitmentsfor a range of sectors that we have identified as higherrisk. The E\&S Risk Framework operationalises ourcommitments and guides our due diligence across ourunderwriting and investment activities.

Sensitive sectors



Biodiversity and protected areas

Protected areas, such as World Heritage Sites, arerecognised for their unparalleled beauty, globalenvironmental and cultural significance and/or biologicaldiversity, and for the important economic, social andenvironmental benefits they provide to people. These sitesdeliver critical environmental services such as stabilisingsoils, preventing floods and capturing carbon, all of whichincrease our resilience to the most harmful impacts of awarming climate. QBE also recognises the importance ofcultural heritage for current and future generations andseeks to protect areas of significant cultural heritage andvalue from the adverse impacts of project activities. QBErecognises that customer activities may have materialimpacts on protected areas that could substantially harmthe biodiversity and cultural value of these sites.QBE is committed to protecting World Heritage Sites.We encourage companies to adopt and adhere toindustry standards and practices to protect these places.QBE will not knowingly directly insure or directly investin projects in severe risk sectors (oil and gas, mining andlarge-scale hydropower) located in World Heritage Sites ortheir buffer zone, unless there is a prior permit issued byGovernment and UNESCO have raised no objection.Projects in high risk sectors (logging, commercial fishing,agriculture, plantations and large-scale infrastructuresuch as pipelines, roads and mega-ports) located in WorldHeritage Sites or their buffer zone will be assessed in linewith the World Heritage Site risk assessment checklist.



Forestry

The forestry sector is considered to be high risk,particularly in areas with weak social and environmentalregulation. The forestry sector includes growingand harvesting forests, and timber processing e.g.manufacturing wooden furniture, pulp and paper millsand trading in forestry (related) products. Social risksinclude adverse human rights conditions such as poor,unsafe working conditions, child and forced labour andforced relocation. Environmental risks are related todeforestation and biodiversity loss.

Energy



Coal

Due to the thermal coal industry’s high emissionsintensity, the availability of renewable energy and gasas substitutes, and in the absence to date of large-scaledeployment of economically viable carbon capture andstorage technology, we are committed to no longerdirectly investing in and phasing out insurance for thethermal coal industry. QBE will:• Not invest directly in companies that derive more than5% of revenue and/or power generation from thermalcoal.
