EXCLUSION POLICY: A CLEAR MESSAGE WHENNEEDED



Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management's (France) Responsible Investmentapproach aims to both reduce risks and identify opportunities related to sustainabledevelopment issues. As an active, long-term asset management company, we aimnot only to direct our investment choices towards the most responsible companies,but also to support them in the evolution of their business model and practicestowards a more sustainable world. In this respect, exclusions are a last resort forEdmond de Rothschild Asset Management (France).However, we exclude securities whose holding could be considered contrary toregulations or practices that we consider least compatible with our approach as aresponsible investor, particularly concerning climate issues.

Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (France) has established a formalexclusion policy

• Sector exclusion policy that includes controversial weapons, thermal coal, nonconventional fossil energy, oil palm and tobacco;

• Normative exclusion policy that covers the violations of the United NationGlobal Compact (UNGC) 1 .

This exclusion policy is accompanied by a strategy of engagement and activedialogue. It covers all our portfolios, all asset classes and geographical areas, and isimplemented in the management mandates of institutional clients unless the clientexpressly refuses.Exclusions are set as pre-trade and post-trade blocking limits in the managementtool to ensure compliance. The exclusion lists are updated at least annually.



SCOPE OF COVERAGE



This policy applies to all issuers, regardless of their country of origin. This policyapplies to all open-ended funds managed by Edmond de Rothschild AssetManagement (France), and is implemented in the dedicated funds and managementmandates, unless the client expressly declines.

CONTROVERSIAL WEAPONS



This exclusion policy concerns securities involved in the production or sale ofweapons prohibited by international conventions (cluster bombs and anti-personnelmines, biological and chemical weapons including white phosphorus weapons) inthe World zone for all funds under management.

The exclusion zone is as follows:

• Anti-personnel mines (APMs), the use of which has been prohibited by theOttawa Convention since 1999;

• Cluster munitions, the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of which isprohibited by the 2008 Oslo Convention;

• Chemical and biological weapons including white phosphorus weapons, theuse of which is prohibited by the 1972 Biological and Toxin WeaponsConvention (entered into force in 1975) and the 1993 Chemical WeaponsConvention (entered into force in April 1997).

Using the exclusion bases provided by MSCI ESG Research rating agency, as well aspublic lists regularly updated by some twenty institutional investors in France andaround the world (e.g. Norwegian Pension Fund, New Zealand Super Fund, etc.),the Responsible Investment team establishes a proprietary exclusion list that targetscompanies producing/selling banned weapons, as well as suppliers of essentialcomponents required for their production.



THERMAL COAL



Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management's (France) policy of excluding thermalcoal is in line with our Responsible Investment strategy and more specifically withour Climate and biodiversity strategy which aims in particular to "decarbonise" ourportfolios by 2050.

The burning of coal is the most important source of global warming, while electricitygeneration is the main user of coal. Reducing coal-related emissions is therefore oneof the most effective ways to ensure an energy transition in line with the ParisAgreement. According to the IEA (International Energy Agency) SustainableDevelopment Scenario (SDS), almost all of the greenhouse gas emission reductions

EDMOND DE ROTHSCHILD ASSET MANAGEMENT (FRANCE) 3/12



for the energy sector - 2.8 gigatonnes out of a total of 3 gigatonnes - will come fromreducing the use of coal in power generation2 .



AGENDA

Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (France) has defined a comprehensiveexit strategy from thermal coal by 2034 based on public statements by companies,encouraging companies to publish a plan to close their coal assets (mines, powerplants) by 2034 outside the OECD, whereas OECD countries should have closed alltheir coal assets. . The scope of the companies concerned covers companiesoperating coal mines and companies involved in thermal coal electricity generation.



EXCLUSION CRITERIA

To this end, in managing its portfolios, Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management(France) excludes :

• All companies developing new coal projects involving the use of thermal coal(due to plans to build new mines/power stations/coal infrastructure;expansion of existing assets; purchase of existing coal assets without a clearcommitment to close them),

• All power generators with an energy mix that is overly exposed to coal (incapacity, production or revenue) where coal's share of energy productionand/or turnover is greater than 5% in OECD countries, 20% elsewhere.

• All mining companies with a high exposure to coal in terms of production,capacity or revenue where coal's share of energy production and/or turnoveris above 5% in OCDE countries, 20% elsewhere, 3



• Companies with a production of more than 5 GW and absolute emissions ofmore than 10 Mt of CO2,

• All financial subsidiaries identified as specifically financing excludedcompanies.

Meanwhile, we believe it is important to encourage companies that exceed the setthresholds to reduce their reliance on thermal coal. In this spirit, we are mindful ofthe carbon trajectory of companies, and do not wish to exclude thermal coalproducers and coal based power generators that make credible and measurablecommitments to reduce their exposure to coal in order to meet the Paris Agreement.



2 According to the most recent version of the IEA's Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) asdescribed in the World Energy Outlook for 2019, energy-related CO2 emissions are to reach 25gigatonnes by 2030 (and 10 Gt by 2050), and coal demand is to decline rapidly to 8% of the energy mixby 2050.



3 Given the difficulty of accessing sufficiently precise data, we consider that an exclusion threshold of5% can be assimilated to an effective exit from coal. We may consider reducing this threshold to 1%when the available data allow us to do so

EDMOND DE ROTHSCHILD ASSET MANAGEMENT (FRANCE) 4/12



Thus, companies are not excluded as long as a clear exit strategy from coal-relatedactivities is made public or the group has a decarbonisation strategy in line with atrajectory consistent with a 2°C / below 2°C scenario validated by the ScienceBased Target (SBT) Initiative.By way of derogation, Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (France) is likelyto consider a subscription in green bonds4 issued by excluded issuers, provided thatthe green bonds are based on one of the two standard green bond guidelines5 .



MAIN SOURCE

Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management's (France) thermal coal exclusion listcurrently covers over 2,300 issuers worldwide. Exclusions are based on the GlobalCoal Exit List of the NGO Urgewald, a reference in the field, after an internalanalysis of the implications of coal and the possible presence of a credible exitfrom coal, validated by the SBT initiative6 .



TABAC



Tobacco is considered by the World Health Organisation to be the greatest threatto public health worldwide. Beyond ethics, Edmond de Rothschild AssetManagement (France) analyses the risks associated with this industry: reputation,taxes, regulations, etc.Our exclusion policy targets companies that produce tobacco or have tobaccodistribution as an important business. The thresholds for exclusion are 5% of turnoverfrom production and distribution, based on data from MSCI ESG Research.Approximately 120 companies are affected to date, in the production or distributionsector.



NON-CONNVENTIONAL FOSSIL FUEL



Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (France) has decided to adopt a climatepolicy of gradually reducing its investments in oil and gas extraction companies,initially targeting non-conventional oil and gas, i.e. those requiring non-traditionalextraction techniques or more difficult or costly extraction conditions.Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (France) supports a gradual divestmentfrom fossil fuels and a redeployment of energy capacities towards other

technologies to ensure a fair transition that takes into account energy needs but alsosupports employment and the regions.



CONTEXT

The Paris Agreement, which aims to keep the rise in temperature to 2°C or less by2100, requires a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve this, thevarious climate scenarios, including the Net Zero scenario for 2050 published by theInternational Energy Agency in May 2021, tend towards a sharp reduction in fossilfuel production in absolute terms.This will start by reducing the use of unconventional energy sources, which have themost harmful consequences on the climate, but also on biodiversity and waterresources: oil sands and Arctic exploitation in the first place. The oil sands 7 areindeed one of the most carbon-intensive sources of oil on their scopes 1 \& 2(emissions generated during the extraction and preparation of the raw material forrefining).As for production in the Arctic, the impact on biodiversity in the event of accidentsor leaks is major for fragile marine and coastal ecosystems.



EXCLUSION CRITERIA

Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (France) has decided to progressivelyexclude unconventional oil and gas companies from its portfolios, starting with themost controversial techniques given their negative impact on the environment.



• Exclusion of players who produce more than 20% of their oil productionfrom oil sands extraction.



• Exclusion of industry players with more than 20% of their hydrocarbonproduction in the Arctic.



• Exclusion of industry players who produce more than 20% of theirhydrocarbons from ultra-deep offshore drilling.



• Exclusion of industry players that produce more than 20% of theirhydrocarbons from coal bed methane 8 .



7 A mixture of crude bitumen, sand, clay mineral and water, the extraction of which degrades vast areasof land, requires excessive amounts of water and energy, and produces huge quantities of toxic sludge.On a life-cycle basis, fuel derived from oil sands generates up to 37% more greenhouse gas emissionsthan fuel from conventional oil.



8 Gas mainly consisting of methane, generated by a carbonaceous type of bedrock.

EDMOND DE ROTHSCHILD ASSET MANAGEMENT (FRANCE) 6/12



We rely on data and definitions from Urgewald's Global Oil \& Gas Exit list (GOGEL),MSCI ESG Research and the results of our dialogues with companies.Companies with an oil exit program and/or projects aiming at carbon neutrality in2050 ideally validated by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) 9 could remaineligible for investment after validation by the Responsible Investment (RI) team.Companies generating less than 1% of their revenues from non-conventional fossilfuels are not covered by the exclusion.Green bond issues 10 from industry players could also remain eligible provided thatthe green bonds are based on one of the two Green bond standard guidelines 11 .

Our exclusion policy is accompanied by a clear and precise commitment policy,asking companies to propose a strategy of divestment from the activitiesmentioned, of support for employment and the territories, and of investment in thecontributing activities.



9 SBTi is a partnership between CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) andthe World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). SBTi aims to encourage ambitious climate action in theprivate sector by enabling organisations to set science-based emission reduction targets.

10 Green bonds are bonds whose returns and risks are linked to specific underlying environmentalprojects (e.g. green infrastructure projects).

11 Green Bond principles or EU Green Bond Standard: The Green Bond Principles (GBP) have becomethe leading global framework for this asset class. They are all based on four pillars: ▪ (1) Product use, ▪

(2) Project evaluation and selection process, ▪ (3) Product management, and ▪ (4) Reporting (see ICMA,2018).The EU Green Bond standard proposes a framework based on the following requirements: ▪ A lignment

of taxonomy ▪ Transparency ▪ External review ▪ Supervision by the European Securities and MarketsAuthority (ESMA) of reviewers.

EDMOND DE ROTHSCHILD ASSET MANAGEMENT (FRANCE) 7/12



AGENDA

As conventional natural gas has a lower carbon profile than oil and especially coal,several scenarios present it as a transition energy at least until 2040. However, weare looking into the possibility of extending our divestment policy to shale gas. Wewill also study the possibility of introducing an absolute volume from non-conventional energies.

We are aiming for a total exit from unconventional fossil fuels by 2040.



PALM OIL

BACKGROUND

Biodiversity and climate change are closely linked. Deforestation is a major cause ofbiodiversity loss, and among the causes of deforestation for which the EuropeanUnion is responsible, palm oil comes first (34%) 12 . The risks associated with growingand trading palm oil include deforestation and forest degradation, landappropriation and human rights violations. RSPO 13 certification (Roundtable onSustainable Palm Oil ) with the most stringent requirements is the only risk mitigationmeasure we can rely on. Controversies reveal environmental and/or social risks.



EXCLUSION CRITERIA

Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (France) has therefore decided toexclude companies producing or distributing palm oil with a high environmental risk.Exclusion of producing or distributing companies with more than 5% of sales in palmoil anda/ have less than 50% of their palm oil plantations certified to RSPO standards or b/that violate any of the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).Exclusions are made on the basis of available data, notably MSCI ESG Research andinternal research.



12 Regulation (eu) 2023/1115 of the european parliament and of the council

13 RSPO certification assures individuals that RSPO members who produce or physicallyhandle RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) have achieved RSPO certification. Thisincludes assurance that the member has committed to and complied with sustainabilityrequirements, and can claim and communicate its certified status throughout the supplychain.
