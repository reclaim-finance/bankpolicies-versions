Climate change is a significant

issue which is already impacting

our business, customers and

community. We seek to play our part

in addressing these impacts, through

our ambition to become a net-zero,

climate resilient bank.



Our climate strategy is structured along three action areas

that focus on our own operations, supporting customers

and advocating for positive change.

We aim to deliver on our strategy through the actions

and initiatives set out in our Action Plan. Unless specified,

we aim to implement the actions in our Action Plan by

30 September 2025. Other targets refer to Westpac

Group’s financial year, e.g. 2030 targets to be achieved

by 30 September 2030.

OUR CLIMATE CHANGE

POSITION STATEMENT

AND ACTION PLAN



Our Climate Change Position

Statement (Position Statement) sets

out our positions on key climate

change risks and opportunities for our

business, customers and community.



It provides the framework within which we seek to

conduct business, support customers and engage with

stakeholders. It outlines the actions that drive our focus

and guide our people as we seek to become a net-zero,

climate resilient bank.

Our Position Statement is supported by our Climate

Change Action Plan (Action Plan), which outlines the

actions we are taking to deliver on our ambition and

commitments. It includes our transition plans, in line with

our commitment to the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA).

We will review our Position Statement and Action Plan

annually so they remain relevant as climate science

advances, requirements and opportunities for transition

and resilience evolve, and guidance and policy develops.



Our Position Statement is supplemented by a suite of

position statements for sensitive sectors and related

sustainability issues. For example:

— Natural Capital – We recognise the interplay between

climate change and natural capital risks, and that their

mitigation requires a comprehensive approach that

balances both nature and climate issues. Westpac’s

Natural Capital Position Statement sets out our

principles and ambitions to become a bank that

supports nature positive outcomes. It includes the steps

required to understand the key nature-related risks

and opportunities for our business, customers and the

community.

— Human Rights – Climate change results in both risks

and opportunities that impact employees, communities

and customers. As part of our NZBA commitment we

seek to consider and address impacts on people (both

adverse and positive) associated with climate change

and the transition to a net-zero economy. Our Human

Rights Position Statement and Action Plan outlines

our positions and action plan to support and advance

human rights through a just and inclusive transition.

Our Position Statement and Action Plan are governed

and managed in line with our sustainability governance

and oversight structure. For further details, refer to the

sustainability governance and risk management section of

our Annual Report. We will also report progress against

our Action Plan as part of our annual climate-related

disclosures.

A SCIENCE-BASED TRANSITION

TO A NET-ZERO EMISSIONS ECONOMY

IS REQUIRED BY 2050



We support the scientific evidence on human-induced global

warming produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

Change. We believe in the need to limit global warming to

1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, which is achievable only

if the economy transitions to net-zero emissions by 2050.



OUR APPROACH SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT WITH

THOROUGH DISCLOSURES



Accurate, timely and relevant information on climate-related risks

and opportunities is key to assessing and managing the impacts

of climate change. We aim to be transparent on our approach and

how we support customers to manage climate-related risks

and opportunities.



TRANSITION SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN,

INCLUSIVE AND SAFEGUARD OUR NATURAL

ENVIRONMENT



The transition to net-zero emissions should be well planned and

consider other factors, such as human rights and safeguarding

the natural environment. This requires increased adoption of

renewable energy and clean technologies, enhancing

bio-sequestration, reducing deforestation and addressing human

rights impacts as part of the transition.



COLLECTIVE ACTION

IS VITAL



A net-zero economy depends on collective action and requires

all stakeholders to play their part. This includes governments

following through on their commitments to support transition

while also meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

We believe in advocating for positive change and will continue to

collaborate on initiatives that work towards net-zero and

climate resilience.



ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD REDUCE

RISKS AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR

BUSINESS AND CUSTOMERS



Westpac has long considered climate-related risk a financial risk.

We believe managing the risks and leveraging the opportunities

is good business, for customers and us. While investments

are required across the economy to decarbonise, appropriate

government policies that incentivise and support transition should

lead to improved economic growth and resilience.

ACTION 1 –

NET-ZERO AND

CLIMATE RESILIENCE

IN OUR OPERATIONS



We are committed to reducing

the climate change impacts of our

operations1 aligned with a 1.5°C

pathway. We continue to reduce

emissions from our own operations

towards net-zero by 2050 or sooner.



Reducing our scope 1 and 2 emissions

Our target for operational scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions

reduction is 64% by 2025 and 76% by 2030 relative to a

2021 2 baseline. To achieve these targets, we are working

to reduce emissions across our property portfolio and are

committed to sourcing the equivalent of 100% of our global

electricity demand from renewable sources by 2025 3 . We

also aim to transition our Australian and New Zealand fleet

vehicles to 100% electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030 4 .



Reducing our scope 3 upstream emissions

Our target for scope 3 absolute upstream emissions 5

reduction is 50% by 2030 relative to a 2021 2 baseline. We

aim to work with key suppliers to help and encourage them

to reduce their emissions, as well as to consider supplier

climate strategies in our sourcing decisions.



1 Includes Westpac Group operations in Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States, Germany, China, Singapore, Fiji and Papua New Guinea.

2 2021 baselines for scope 1, 2 and scope 3 upstream emissions targets adjusted for COVID-19 pandemic and other impacts. Refer to the Sustainability

Index and Datasheet for baselines and details of included emissions sources.

3 The challenges of developing local renewable energy infrastructure and the lack of renewable energy certificate markets in some of the international

markets Westpac operates in are a recognised risk to this target. We are monitoring this risk and actively seeking to solve for these challenges as we work

towards meeting our commitment.

4 May include hybrid or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) where required to serve customers in locations where electric vehicle charging

infrastructure is not widely available. Supply chain challenges and roll-out of charging infrastructure at a national scale are risks to this target at the time

of setting. This target will be reviewed in 2025 to consider the status of these risks.

5 Refer to the Sustainability Index and Datasheet for scope 3 upstream emissions detailed by source.

6 Prior to 2019, the Australian Government’s Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard for Organisations was known as National Carbon Offset Standard

Carbon Neutral Program.

7 Prior to 2020, the Toitū net carbonzero certification was known as the Toitū carbonzero certification.



Offsetting our residual emissions

Our aim is to actively reduce our scope 1, 2 and scope 3

upstream emissions, recognising that for some emissions

sources the speed at which we can reduce may be limited

by technology availability, policy and economic viability.

We seek to maintain certification for our Australian

operations under the Australian Government’s Climate

Active Carbon Neutral Standard for Organisations 6 . For

our New Zealand operations, we seek to maintain Toitū

net carbonzero certification7. We purchase carbon credits

to offset our residual scope 1, 2 and scope 3 upstream

emissions as required to maintain our certifications. Further

information on our certifications and related carbon credit

purchases can be found on our website.



Build physical resilience into our business and

operations

The physical risks of climate change have the potential

to significantly affect our ability to operate and support

customers. Significant natural disasters and changing

climate patterns may disrupt our operations by impacting

our people, systems, supply chain, infrastructure, and

assets, including branches. We are improving our

assessment of these risks and strengthening controls in

areas such as business continuity and property leasing.

We are working to monitor these risks and build our

climate resilience through strategies, which include

diversifying critical operations across geographic locations

and assessing the operational resilience of our material

suppliers.

STATEMENT AND ACTION PLAN

ACTION 2 –

SUPPORTING CUSTOMERS’

TRANSITION TO NET-ZERO

AND TO BUILD THEIR

CLIMATE RESILIENCE



A. Supporting customers’ transition

to net-zero



Reduce our portfolio financed emissions

Having joined the NZBA, we are committed to aligning

our lending portfolio with net-zero financed emissions

by 2050, consistent with a 1.5°C pathway. In accordance

with our commitment, we have set interim 2030 sector

lending targets in the NZBA priority sectors. This includes

addressing prioritised aspects of the fossil fuel value chain,

i.e. oil and gas, thermal coal mining and power generation.

We will continue updating targets to meet NZBA

requirements where data and methodologies allow.

Further detail on our target setting, including assumptions

and calculation approaches, can be found in our

climate-related disclosures.

Our targets and high-level plan to meet them are outlined in

our Action Plan. We continue to integrate and operationalise

our targets into our processes and lending decisions.



FACILITATED EMISSIONS

Our NZBA 2030 sector lending targets relate to the

emissions associated with our lending (i.e. financed

emissions). They do not cover emissions associated

with transactions we facilitate (i.e. facilitated emissions).

Transactions we facilitate include debt capital markets

activities. This also includes underwriting, arranging

and/or bookrunning for syndicated loans. These

transactions are, however, subject to Westpac’s

Sustainability Risk Management Framework, including

assessment and escalation where required. We will

review our position on facilitated emissions as guidance

and methodologies mature.



OUR APPROACH TO CARBON

OFFSETS FOR OUR NZBA 2030

SECTOR LENDING TARGETS

We believe reducing emissions should be a priority

action in achieving targets and the transition to net-

zero. We recognise carbon offsets are likely to play a

role to supplement decarbonisation in line with climate

science-based scenarios. We do not intend to purchase

carbon offsets to meet our NZBA 2030 sector lending

targets. We understand that some customers are

using or may use offsets to meet their decarbonisation

targets and some of the data we use may also include

customer offsets. Guidance around the quality and

utilisation of carbon credits is a rapidly evolving area

and we will review our approach to the use of carbon

offsets in line with NZBA Guidance.

OUR CLIMATE CHANGEPOSITION STATEMENTAND ACTION PLAN OUR PRINCIPLES OUR ACTION AREASOUR AMBITION OUR ACTION PLAN7

Reduce our portfolio financed emissions (continued)

Our positions on oil and gas, coal mining and power

generation sectors are summarised below. They operate

alongside our NZBA 2030 sector lending targets.



Upstream oil and gas1 :

— Subject to national energy security2 :

• we will not provide project finance or bond

facilitation for the development of new (greenfield)

or expansionary oil and gas fields, including new

associated dedicated infrastructure 3 , unless in

accordance with the International Energy Agency

Net-Zero by 2050 scenario 4 .

• we will continue to provide corporate lending and

bond facilitation where the customer has a credible

transition plan 5 in place by 30 September 2025.

• we will work with customers to support their

development of their credible transition plans.

— We will not provide project finance for oil and gas

exploration in high-risk frontier basins, such as Arctic

and Antarctic refuges or for oil sands development.

— We will not provide project finance for exploration of

shale, offshore deep water or ultra-deep-water 6 oil

and gas.

We continue to engage with upstream oil and gas

customers to gain insight into their transition plans. While

the sector is making progress in developing emissions

reduction plans and achieving reductions to scope 1

and 2 emissions, we recognise there are challenges in

establishing scope 3 reduction plans.

Through our engagement we deepened our understanding

of how challenging it will be for the sector to establish

1.5°C-aligned transition plans covering scope 1, 2 and 3 by

30 September 2025. We will engage further to understand

our customers’ evolving decarbonisation strategies.

Alongside this, we will also continue to monitor, assess and

be guided by the latest science and government policy,

while considering energy security and affordability.



1 Includes exploration, extraction and drilling companies, all activities of integrated oil and gas companies (IOCs), tolling and stand-alone refineries and

LNG producers. Does not include downstream retail and distribution, pipeline infrastructure, storage and transport, nor trading entities.

2 National energy security refers to circumstances where an Australian or New Zealand Government or regulator determines (or takes a formal public

position) that additional supply is necessary for national energy security and Westpac’s funding is able to support such additional supply.

3 New associated dedicated infrastructure means new gas collection, storage and processing infrastructure dedicated solely to greenfield or expansionary

oil and gas extraction projects including floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels, gas processing plant and transmission pipelines.

4 The International Energy Agency Net-Zero by 2050 (2021) scenario specifies that no new (greenfield) oil and gas fields are needed beyond those projects

that have already been committed (i.e. approved for development) as of 18 May 2021.

5 A credible transition plan should be developed by reference to the best available science and should include scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and actions the

company will take to achieve greenhouse gas reductions aligned with pathways to net-zero by 2050, or sooner, consistent with a maximum temperature

rise of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.

6 Deep water refers to water depths of greater than 1,000 ft (300m) but less than 5,000 ft (1,500m). Ultra-deep-water refers to water depths of greater

than 5,000 ft (1,500m).

7 Thermal coal sector is defined to encompass customers whose business involves the production and sale of thermal coal, with adjacent sectors (including

mining service providers) excluded. Transactional banking and rehabilitation bonds are also excluded. From FY25 this definition will be updated to exclude

metallurgical coal mines that produce a thermal coal product and diversified miners that produce a thermal coal product where their dominant activity is

not thermal coal. This change has been made to align with Version 2 of the NZBA Guidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks, updated in April 2024.

8 Annually, we calculate revenue percentage by assessing customers’ full-year audited financial reports, based on a rolling average of the prior three years

of revenues.



Thermal coal mining7 :

Given the significant emissions generated from thermal

coal, we seek to eliminate our exposure to thermal

coal mining and have set short- and medium-term

commitments.

— We will not provide any project financing to new,

expansions or extensions of thermal coal mines.

— For institutional customers with ≥15%8 of their revenue

coming directly from thermal coal mining, we will:

• effective immediately, not onboard new customers

• effective immediately, not provide corporate lending

or bond facilitation. This includes for new, expansions

or extensions of life of existing thermal coal mines

• have zero lending by 30 September 2025.

— For institutional customers with \>5% of revenue coming

directly from thermal coal, an NZBA-aligned thermal

coal target will continue to apply, as outlined in our

Action Plan on page 12.



Metallurgical coal mining:

— We will continue to support the metallurgical coal

sector as it remains critical for steel production at scale,

which is required to support the transition to net-zero

emissions.

— We will not provide project finance for new (greenfield)

metallurgical coal projects.

— We will continue to explore opportunities to work with

customers to support the development of alternative

products and processes, where appropriate.



Power generation:

— We will not provide project finance to new (greenfield)

coal-fired power generation facilities.

— We will consider the intersecting requirements of

emissions reduction, the feasibility of emerging

technologies, as well as energy affordability, security

and reliability.



ACTION 2

WESTPAC GROUP 2023-2025 CLIMATE CHANGE POSITION STATEMENT AND ACTION PLAN

8

Become the transition partner of choice

As a bank, one of the most significant roles we can play

in the transition to a net-zero economy is to support

customers in their transition and to mobilise capital.

For institutional customers we seek to:

— build our capability and evolve our products and

services to better meet their emerging needs

— where applicable, support their transition by providing

guidance on climate strategy and in the development of

transition plans

— offer a suite of finance solutions and products to help

them meet their sustainability goals, including changing

business models, investments in emissions reduction,

low/zero carbon technologies, sustainable finance and

infrastructure.

We have developed a pilot net-zero transition plan

framework for assessing and engaging with institutional

customers. This has been informed by a range of local and

international sources, such as Climate Action 100+ and the

Transition Pathway Initiative. We will continue to evolve our

framework as standards evolve and further engage with

our customers. We aim to continue to apply a framework

across key customers in carbon intensive sectors in

FY24. For more detail, refer to our annual climate-related

disclosures.

We also see opportunities to further support commercial,

small and medium businesses and consumers in their

transition to net-zero. This includes engaging with

businesses and consumers, and providing access to

products and services that support customers to reduce

their environmental footprint and transition to a low carbon

economy.



As we work towards becoming the transition partner

of choice, we seek to increase our sustainable finance

offering. By 2030, our targets are to provide $55bn of

lending and $40bn of bond facilitation activities that are

aligned with our Sustainable Finance Framework. For

further information refer to the Westpac Sustainable

Finance Framework available on our website.



B. Help build climate resilience



Help our customers and communities build resilience

to the physical impacts of climate change



Institutional and business customers

Climate change physical risks can impact the value of

assets and projects we finance for customers. Climate

change can also impact customer operations and supply

and distribution chains. Customers’ adaptation plans

become increasingly important to reduce their vulnerability

to physical impacts of climate change. We seek to support

customers as they develop adaptation measures to build

climate resilience. This also enables surrounding industries

and communities to become more resilient. We seek to

understand where physical risks will have a material impact

across our institutional and business banking portfolio.

We support customers, including small business

customers, to get back on their feet after experiencing

a natural disaster event by providing access to relief

packages, giving customers payment relief and time to

start the repair and rebuild. In New Zealand, our Adverse

Natural Events Policy provides a comprehensive range offinancial assistance measures to customers impacted by

natural disasters.

Agribusiness plays a fundamental role in providing food

and other essential goods, driving economic prosperity and

supporting livelihoods and communities. Climate change

physical risks are increasingly material to agribusinesses.

We recognise the ability to adapt to a changing climate is

vital, not just for agribusiness customers, but for society as

a whole. We seek to help customers respond to physical

risks of climate change by:

— providing access to products and services that support

climate adaptation and resilience

— engaging with them to support their insights on climate

adaptation measures and practices

— supporting customers affected by drought and natural

disasters.



Consumer banking

As a major residential mortgage lender, we have a role

to play in helping customers understand and respond to

the impacts of climate change. In delivering products and

services for customers, we seek to provide customers with

information to understand and prepare for the impacts of

natural disasters on their homes and communities. We also

support customers as they recover after a natural disaster

event through access to hardship assistance and disaster

relief packages to customers and communities affected.

We monitor our physical risks and seek to understand

our risk exposure and vulnerability across our residential

mortgages portfolio.



CARBON TRADING

Through our Carbon Trading Desk, we facilitate the

purchase and sale of accredited 1 offsets. We seek to:

— support customers with their decarbonisation plans

by facilitating access to the Renewable Energy

Certificates market in Australia and carbon markets

both in Australia (e.g. Australian Carbon Credit Units)

and New Zealand (New Zealand Units)

— help Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) participants

trade in the New Zealand ETS (NZ ETS)

— develop capabilities to support producers of carbon

credits by providing them with capital and risk

management solutions.

To support and guide our approach to our Carbon

Trading Desk we seek to proactively engage with our

customers while participating in industry working

groups to help shape the future of carbon markets.

We are also a member of the Carbon Market Institute.



1 Accredited offsets refer to carbon offset credits that have been

verified by a recognised independent party under international

standards as appropriate at the time of creation of the offset.

Westpac does not provide accreditation services, nor does it

engage in the accreditation process.

ACTION 3 –

COLLABORATE FOR

IMPACT ON INITIATIVES

TOWARDS NET-ZERO AND

CLIMATE RESILIENCE



Addressing climate change requires collective action

and collaboration.

We recognise the important role we can play by

supporting and participating in international, national and

industry-based initiatives to progress collective action on

climate change.

For example, we are a founding member of the United

Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative’s

Principles for Responsible Banking and have committed

to the NZBA. Further details on our participation in

industry groups can be found in our annual climate-related

disclosures.

We also understand that governmental policy response

to climate change will influence the speed of transition

and climate change adaptation. We seek to engage with

government, industry and business associations. We aim to

identify and collaborate with industry groups on initiatives

that align with our principles and ambition to become a

net-zero, climate resilient bank. We continue to review our

membership of industry associations and their advocacy

activity with regards to climate change in line with our

Industry Association Principles1 .



1 Our Industry Association Principles can be found on our website.



Westpac’s position on climate change policies comprises

three pillars.

1. Policies need to be aligned with the temperature goals

of the Paris Agreement, be capable of achieving the

Nationally Determined Contributions that represent each

country’s committed global emissions reduction targets

in the short and medium term, and give consideration to

the long-term target of reducing emissions to net-zero

by 2050 without relying on carry-over credits from the

Kyoto Protocol.

2\. Policies should:

— deliver a clear framework to support the development

and deployment of low-emissions technology by

providing certainty over a timeline sufficient to match

investment horizons which are often long-term

— include strategies to increase resilience and promote

adaptation for impacted communities, companies

and sectors

— incentivise increased transparency and support

development and adoption of reporting frameworks

to improve reliability, relevance and measurability of

climate-related disclosures.

3\. A broad market-based price on carbon is the most

effective, affordable, flexible and equitable means of

achieving emissions reductions across the economy.

transmission and distribution network) with Flow Power to source renewable electricity from Ararat Wind Farm in Victoria and Berri Solar Farm + Battery

in South Australia, that will complete the 100% renewables transition for Westpac Australia. The third phase aims to deliver the remainder of the transition

to achieve the equivalent of 100% renewables supply for our global operations.

4 The challenges of developing local renewable energy infrastructure and the lack of renewable energy certificate markets in some of the international

markets Westpac operates in are a recognised risk to this target. We are monitoring this risk and actively seeking to solve for these challenges as we work

towards meeting our commitment.

5 May include hybrid or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) where required to serve customers in locations where electric vehicle charging

infrastructure is not widely available. Supply chain challenges and roll-out of charging infrastructure at a national scale are risks to this target at the time

of setting. This target will be reviewed in 2025 to consider the status of these risks.

6 Our review is expected to result in an expansion of our scope 3 upstream emissions profile.

1 Includes exploration, extraction and drilling companies, all activities of integrated oil and gas companies (IOCs), tolling and stand-alone refineries and

LNG producers. Does not include downstream retail and distribution, pipeline infrastructure, storage and transport, nor trading entities.

2 Thermal coal sector is defined to encompass customers whose business involves the production and sale of thermal coal, with adjacent sectors (including

mining service providers) excluded. Transactional banking and rehabilitation bonds are also excluded. From FY25 this definition will be updated to exclude

metallurgical coal mines that produce a thermal coal product and diversified miners that produce a thermal coal product where their dominant activity is

not thermal coal. This change has been made to align with Version 2 of the NZBA Guidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks, updated in April 2024.

3 Annually, we calculate the revenue percentage by assessing customers’ full-year audited financial reports, based on a rolling average of the prior three

years of revenues.

4 Refers to scope 1 and 2 emissions of power generators, i.e. customers with \>10% revenue coming from power generation or \>5% revenues from thermal

coal electricity generation. In Australia, this applies to customers under ANZSIC (1993) code 3610 with National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting

Scheme designated generation facilities and have \>10% revenue coming from power generation.

5 This target covers customers that produce clinker in-house. The target has been set for customers’ scope 1 and 2 emissions in relation to the production of

cement. It covers emissions generated from calcination in clinker production as well as fuel combustion and electricity consumption associated with the

cement production process.

6 We use ANZSIC code 2741 for initial screening of customers, then supplement with more detailed knowledge about customers’ business to determine

companies involved in the production of crude steel. Excludes downstream manufacturing, processing of end products and fabrication of products from

steel (noting some such customers have ANZSIC 2741).

1 Scope 1 and 2 emissions for alumina refining and aluminium smelting on an emissions intensity basis. Tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2 -e) per

tonne of primary aluminium produced per annum.

2 Covers customers that operate scheduled air transport for passengers, including freight operations undertaken by passenger airline operators. We have

excluded any freight only operators, rotary wing aircraft, non-scheduled aircraft operations and aircraft lessors.

3 Passenger kilometres (pkm) is a measure of activity for passenger airline operators.

4 Applies to institutional and commercial relationship-managed Agribusiness customers with Total Committed Exposures (TCE) ≥ $1.5m who are captured

by dairy, beef, sheep and mixed farming ANZSIC codes.

5 Land management emissions refers to operational emissions resulting from how land is managed rather than emissions resulting from land-use change.

Land management emissions arise from processes such as enteric fermentation, biomass burning and fertiliser use.

6 Fat protein corrected milk (FPCM) is a commonly used measure of dairy farm outputs. FPCM is milk corrected for its fat and protein content to a regional

standard. In the Science Based Target initiative Forest, Land and Agriculture Guidance (SBTi FLAG), reference scenario we used for setting Agriculture

targets, dairy production is expressed in tonnes of FPCM.

7 In the SBTi FLAG tool interface animal commodities are expressed in tonnes of fresh weight (FW) of carcass where carcass is defined as animal meat,

fresh, chilled or frozen, with bone.

8 A forest that is a natural ecosystem, possessing many or most of the characteristics of a forest native to the given site, including species composition,

structure, and ecological function. Natural forests include: (i) Primary forest that have been subject to major human impacts in recent history. (ii)

Regenerated forest that were subject to major impacts in the past (for instance by agriculture, livestock raising, tree plantations, or intensive logging)

but where the main causes of impact have ceased or greatly diminished and the ecosystem has attained structure, function and composition of a natural

forest. (iii) Managed natural forests where much of the ecosystem’s composition, structure, and ecological function exist in the presence of activities

such as harvesting of timber or small-scale cultivation. (iv) Forests that have been partially degraded by anthropogenic or natural causes (e.g. harvesting,fire, climate change, invasive species, or others) but where the land has not been converted to another use and where degradation does not result in the

sustained reduction of tree cover below the thresholds that define a forest or loss in structure, function or composition. The categories “natural forest”

and “tree plantation” are mutually exclusive, though in some cases the distinction may be nuanced. Source: Accountability Framework Initiative. The
