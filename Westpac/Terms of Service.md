OUR CLIMATE CHANGEPOSITION STATEMENTAND ACTION PLAN



Our Climate Change PositionStatement (Position Statement) setsout our positions on key climatechange risks and opportunities for ourbusiness, customers and community.



It provides the framework within which we seek toconduct business, support customers and engage withstakeholders. It outlines the actions that drive our focusand guide our people as we seek to become a net-zero,climate resilient bank.Our Position Statement is supported by our ClimateChange Action Plan (Action Plan), which outlines theactions we are taking to deliver on our ambition andcommitments. It includes our transition plans, in line withour commitment to the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA).We will review our Position Statement and Action Planannually so they remain relevant as climate scienceadvances, requirements and opportunities for transitionand resilience evolve, and guidance and policy develops.

Our Position Statement is supplemented by a suite ofposition statements for sensitive sectors and relatedsustainability issues. For example:

— Natural Capital – We recognise the interplay betweenclimate change and natural capital risks, and that theirmitigation requires a comprehensive approach thatbalances both nature and climate issues. Westpac’s

Natural Capital Position Statement sets out ourprinciples and ambitions to become a bank thatsupports nature positive outcomes. It includes the stepsrequired to understand the key nature-related risksand opportunities for our business, customers and thecommunity.

— Human Rights – Climate change results in both risksand opportunities that impact employees, communitiesand customers. As part of our NZBA commitment weseek to consider and address impacts on people (bothadverse and positive) associated with climate changeand the transition to a net-zero economy. Our HumanRights Position Statement and Action Plan outlinesour positions and action plan to support and advancehuman rights through a just and inclusive transition.Our Position Statement and Action Plan are governedand managed in line with our sustainability governanceand oversight structure. For further details, refer to thesustainability governance and risk management section ofour Annual Report. We will also report progress againstour Action Plan as part of our annual climate-relateddisclosures.

A SCIENCE-BASED TRANSITIONTO A NET-ZERO EMISSIONS ECONOMYIS REQUIRED BY 2050



We support the scientific evidence on human-induced globalwarming produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange. We believe in the need to limit global warming to1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, which is achievable onlyif the economy transitions to net-zero emissions by 2050.



OUR APPROACH SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT WITHTHOROUGH DISCLOSURES



Accurate, timely and relevant information on climate-related risksand opportunities is key to assessing and managing the impactsof climate change. We aim to be transparent on our approach andhow we support customers to manage climate-related risksand opportunities.



TRANSITION SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN,INCLUSIVE AND SAFEGUARD OUR NATURALENVIRONMENT



The transition to net-zero emissions should be well planned andconsider other factors, such as human rights and safeguardingthe natural environment. This requires increased adoption ofrenewable energy and clean technologies, enhancingbio-sequestration, reducing deforestation and addressing humanrights impacts as part of the transition.



COLLECTIVE ACTIONIS VITAL



A net-zero economy depends on collective action and requiresall stakeholders to play their part. This includes governmentsfollowing through on their commitments to support transitionwhile also meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement.We believe in advocating for positive change and will continue tocollaborate on initiatives that work towards net-zero andclimate resilience.



ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD REDUCERISKS AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OURBUSINESS AND CUSTOMERS



Westpac has long considered climate-related risk a financial risk.We believe managing the risks and leveraging the opportunitiesis good business, for customers and us. While investmentsare required across the economy to decarbonise, appropriategovernment policies that incentivise and support transition shouldlead to improved economic growth and resilience.

ACTION 1 –NET-ZERO ANDCLIMATE RESILIENCEIN OUR OPERATIONS



We are committed to reducingthe climate change impacts of ouroperations1 aligned with a 1.5°Cpathway. We continue to reduceemissions from our own operationstowards net-zero by 2050 or sooner.



Reducing our scope 1 and 2 emissions

Our target for operational scope 1 and 2 absolute emissionsreduction is 64% by 2025 and 76% by 2030 relative to a2021 2 baseline. To achieve these targets, we are workingto reduce emissions across our property portfolio and arecommitted to sourcing the equivalent of 100% of our globalelectricity demand from renewable sources by 2025 3 . Wealso aim to transition our Australian and New Zealand fleetvehicles to 100% electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030 4 .



Reducing our scope 3 upstream emissions

Our target for scope 3 absolute upstream emissions 5reduction is 50% by 2030 relative to a 2021 2 baseline. Weaim to work with key suppliers to help and encourage themto reduce their emissions, as well as to consider supplierclimate strategies in our sourcing decisions.

1 Includes Westpac Group operations in Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States, Germany, China, Singapore, Fiji and Papua New Guinea.2 2021 baselines for scope 1, 2 and scope 3 upstream emissions targets adjusted for COVID-19 pandemic and other impacts. Refer to the SustainabilityIndex and Datasheet for baselines and details of included emissions sources.3 The challenges of developing local renewable energy infrastructure and the lack of renewable energy certificate markets in some of the internationalmarkets Westpac operates in are a recognised risk to this target. We are monitoring this risk and actively seeking to solve for these challenges as we worktowards meeting our commitment.4 May include hybrid or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) where required to serve customers in locations where electric vehicle charginginfrastructure is not widely available. Supply chain challenges and roll-out of charging infrastructure at a national scale are risks to this target at the timeof setting. This target will be reviewed in 2025 to consider the status of these risks.5 Refer to the Sustainability Index and Datasheet for scope 3 upstream emissions detailed by source.6 Prior to 2019, the Australian Government’s Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard for Organisations was known as National Carbon Offset StandardCarbon Neutral Program.7 Prior to 2020, the Toitū net carbonzero certification was known as the Toitū carbonzero certification.



Offsetting our residual emissions

Our aim is to actively reduce our scope 1, 2 and scope 3upstream emissions, recognising that for some emissionssources the speed at which we can reduce may be limitedby technology availability, policy and economic viability.We seek to maintain certification for our Australianoperations under the Australian Government’s ClimateActive Carbon Neutral Standard for Organisations 6 . Forour New Zealand operations, we seek to maintain Toitūnet carbonzero certification7. We purchase carbon creditsto offset our residual scope 1, 2 and scope 3 upstreamemissions as required to maintain our certifications. Furtherinformation on our certifications and related carbon creditpurchases can be found on our website.



Build physical resilience into our business andoperations

The physical risks of climate change have the potentialto significantly affect our ability to operate and supportcustomers. Significant natural disasters and changingclimate patterns may disrupt our operations by impactingour people, systems, supply chain, infrastructure, andassets, including branches. We are improving ourassessment of these risks and strengthening controls inareas such as business continuity and property leasing.We are working to monitor these risks and build ourclimate resilience through strategies, which includediversifying critical operations across geographic locationsand assessing the operational resilience of our materialsuppliers.

ACTION 2 –SUPPORTING CUSTOMERS’TRANSITION TO NET-ZEROAND TO BUILD THEIRCLIMATE RESILIENCE



A. Supporting customers’ transitionto net-zero

Reduce our portfolio financed emissions

Having joined the NZBA, we are committed to aligningour lending portfolio with net-zero financed emissionsby 2050, consistent with a 1.5°C pathway. In accordancewith our commitment, we have set interim 2030 sectorlending targets in the NZBA priority sectors. This includesaddressing prioritised aspects of the fossil fuel value chain,i.e. oil and gas, thermal coal mining and power generation.We will continue updating targets to meet NZBArequirements where data and methodologies allow.Further detail on our target setting, including assumptionsand calculation approaches, can be found in our

climate-related disclosures.Our targets and high-level plan to meet them are outlined inour Action Plan. We continue to integrate and operationaliseour targets into our processes and lending decisions.



FACILITATED EMISSIONS

Our NZBA 2030 sector lending targets relate to theemissions associated with our lending (i.e. financedemissions). They do not cover emissions associatedwith transactions we facilitate (i.e. facilitated emissions).Transactions we facilitate include debt capital marketsactivities. This also includes underwriting, arrangingand/or bookrunning for syndicated loans. Thesetransactions are, however, subject to Westpac’sSustainability Risk Management Framework, includingassessment and escalation where required. We willreview our position on facilitated emissions as guidanceand methodologies mature.



OUR APPROACH TO CARBONOFFSETS FOR OUR NZBA 2030SECTOR LENDING TARGETS

We believe reducing emissions should be a priorityaction in achieving targets and the transition to net-zero. We recognise carbon offsets are likely to play arole to supplement decarbonisation in line with climatescience-based scenarios. We do not intend to purchasecarbon offsets to meet our NZBA 2030 sector lendingtargets. We understand that some customers areusing or may use offsets to meet their decarbonisationtargets and some of the data we use may also includecustomer offsets. Guidance around the quality andutilisation of carbon credits is a rapidly evolving areaand we will review our approach to the use of carbonoffsets in line with NZBA Guidance.

Become the transition partner of choice

As a bank, one of the most significant roles we can playin the transition to a net-zero economy is to supportcustomers in their transition and to mobilise capital.For institutional customers we seek to:

— build our capability and evolve our products andservices to better meet their emerging needs

— where applicable, support their transition by providingguidance on climate strategy and in the development oftransition plans

— offer a suite of finance solutions and products to helpthem meet their sustainability goals, including changingbusiness models, investments in emissions reduction,low/zero carbon technologies, sustainable finance andinfrastructure.We have developed a pilot net-zero transition planframework for assessing and engaging with institutionalcustomers. This has been informed by a range of local andinternational sources, such as Climate Action 100+ and theTransition Pathway Initiative. We will continue to evolve ourframework as standards evolve and further engage withour customers. We aim to continue to apply a frameworkacross key customers in carbon intensive sectors inFY24. For more detail, refer to our annual climate-relateddisclosures.We also see opportunities to further support commercial,small and medium businesses and consumers in theirtransition to net-zero. This includes engaging withbusinesses and consumers, and providing access toproducts and services that support customers to reducetheir environmental footprint and transition to a low carboneconomy.

As we work towards becoming the transition partnerof choice, we seek to increase our sustainable financeoffering. By 2030, our targets are to provide $55bn oflending and $40bn of bond facilitation activities that arealigned with our Sustainable Finance Framework. Forfurther information refer to the Westpac SustainableFinance Framework available on our website.



B. Help build climate resilience

Help our customers and communities build resilienceto the physical impacts of climate change



Institutional and business customers

Climate change physical risks can impact the value ofassets and projects we finance for customers. Climatechange can also impact customer operations and supplyand distribution chains. Customers’ adaptation plansbecome increasingly important to reduce their vulnerabilityto physical impacts of climate change. We seek to supportcustomers as they develop adaptation measures to buildclimate resilience. This also enables surrounding industriesand communities to become more resilient. We seek tounderstand where physical risks will have a material impactacross our institutional and business banking portfolio.We support customers, including small businesscustomers, to get back on their feet after experiencinga natural disaster event by providing access to reliefpackages, giving customers payment relief and time tostart the repair and rebuild. In New Zealand, our AdverseNatural Events Policy provides a comprehensive range offinancial assistance measures to customers impacted bynatural disasters.Agribusiness plays a fundamental role in providing foodand other essential goods, driving economic prosperity andsupporting livelihoods and communities. Climate changephysical risks are increasingly material to agribusinesses.We recognise the ability to adapt to a changing climate isvital, not just for agribusiness customers, but for society asa whole. We seek to help customers respond to physicalrisks of climate change by:

— providing access to products and services that supportclimate adaptation and resilience

— engaging with them to support their insights on climateadaptation measures and practices

— supporting customers affected by drought and naturaldisasters.



Consumer banking

As a major residential mortgage lender, we have a roleto play in helping customers understand and respond tothe impacts of climate change. In delivering products andservices for customers, we seek to provide customers withinformation to understand and prepare for the impacts ofnatural disasters on their homes and communities. We alsosupport customers as they recover after a natural disasterevent through access to hardship assistance and disasterrelief packages to customers and communities affected.We monitor our physical risks and seek to understandour risk exposure and vulnerability across our residentialmortgages portfolio.



CARBON TRADING

Through our Carbon Trading Desk, we facilitate thepurchase and sale of accredited 1 offsets. We seek to:

— support customers with their decarbonisation plansby facilitating access to the Renewable EnergyCertificates market in Australia and carbon marketsboth in Australia (e.g. Australian Carbon Credit Units)and New Zealand (New Zealand Units)

— help Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) participantstrade in the New Zealand ETS (NZ ETS)

— develop capabilities to support producers of carboncredits by providing them with capital and riskmanagement solutions.To support and guide our approach to our CarbonTrading Desk we seek to proactively engage with ourcustomers while participating in industry workinggroups to help shape the future of carbon markets.We are also a member of the Carbon Market Institute.

1 Accredited offsets refer to carbon offset credits that have beenverified by a recognised independent party under internationalstandards as appropriate at the time of creation of the offset.Westpac does not provide accreditation services, nor does itengage in the accreditation process.

ACTION 3 –COLLABORATE FORIMPACT ON INITIATIVESTOWARDS NET-ZERO ANDCLIMATE RESILIENCE



Addressing climate change requires collective actionand collaboration.

We recognise the important role we can play bysupporting and participating in international, national andindustry-based initiatives to progress collective action onclimate change.For example, we are a founding member of the UnitedNations Environment Programme Finance Initiative’sPrinciples for Responsible Banking and have committedto the NZBA. Further details on our participation inindustry groups can be found in our annual climate-relateddisclosures.We also understand that governmental policy responseto climate change will influence the speed of transitionand climate change adaptation. We seek to engage withgovernment, industry and business associations. We aim toidentify and collaborate with industry groups on initiativesthat align with our principles and ambition to become anet-zero, climate resilient bank. We continue to review ourmembership of industry associations and their advocacyactivity with regards to climate change in line with ourIndustry Association Principles1 .

1 Our Industry Association Principles can be found on our website.

Westpac’s position on climate change policies comprisesthree pillars.1. Policies need to be aligned with the temperature goalsof the Paris Agreement, be capable of achieving theNationally Determined Contributions that represent eachcountry’s committed global emissions reduction targetsin the short and medium term, and give consideration tothe long-term target of reducing emissions to net-zeroby 2050 without relying on carry-over credits from theKyoto Protocol.2\. Policies should:

— deliver a clear framework to support the developmentand deployment of low-emissions technology byproviding certainty over a timeline sufficient to matchinvestment horizons which are often long-term

— include strategies to increase resilience and promoteadaptation for impacted communities, companiesand sectors

— incentivise increased transparency and supportdevelopment and adoption of reporting frameworksto improve reliability, relevance and measurability ofclimate-related disclosures.3\. A broad market-based price on carbon is the mosteffective, affordable, flexible and equitable means ofachieving emissions reductions across the economy.

Refer to the Sustainability Index andDatasheet for baselines and details of included emissions sources.2 Refer to the Sustainability Index and Datasheet for scope 3 upstream emissions detailed by source.3 The second phase consists of a virtual power purchase agreement (i.e. generation exported to grid and distributed to sites through the nationaltransmission and distribution network) with Flow Power to source renewable electricity from Ararat Wind Farm in Victoria and Berri Solar Farm + Batteryin South Australia, that will complete the 100% renewables transition for Westpac Australia. The third phase aims to deliver the remainder of the transitionto achieve the equivalent of 100% renewables supply for our global operations.4 The challenges of developing local renewable energy infrastructure and the lack of renewable energy certificate markets in some of the internationalmarkets Westpac operates in are a recognised risk to this target. We are monitoring this risk and actively seeking to solve for these challenges as we worktowards meeting our commitment.5 May include hybrid or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) where required to serve customers in locations where electric vehicle charginginfrastructure is not widely available. Supply chain challenges and roll-out of charging infrastructure at a national scale are risks to this target at the timeof setting. This target will be reviewed in 2025 to consider the status of these risks.6 Our review is expected to result in an expansion of our scope 3 upstream emissions profile.

From FY25 this definition will be updated to excludemetallurgical coal mines that produce a thermal coal product and diversified miners that produce a thermal coal product where their dominant activity isnot thermal coal. This change has been made to align with Version 2 of the NZBA Guidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks, updated in April 2024.3 Annually, we calculate the revenue percentage by assessing customers’ full-year audited financial reports, based on a rolling average of the prior threeyears of revenues.4 Refers to scope 1 and 2 emissions of power generators, i.e. customers with \>10% revenue coming from power generation or \>5% revenues from thermalcoal electricity generation. In Australia, this applies to customers under ANZSIC (1993) code 3610 with National Greenhouse and Energy ReportingScheme designated generation facilities and have \>10% revenue coming from power generation.5 This target covers customers that produce clinker in-house. The target has been set for customers’ scope 1 and 2 emissions in relation to the production ofcement. It covers emissions generated from calcination in clinker production as well as fuel combustion and electricity consumption associated with thecement production process.6 We use ANZSIC code 2741 for initial screening of customers, then supplement with more detailed knowledge about customers’ business to determinecompanies involved in the production of crude steel. Excludes downstream manufacturing, processing of end products and fabrication of products fromsteel (noting some such customers have ANZSIC 2741).



OUR ACTION PLAN

WESTPAC GROUP 2023-2025 CLIMATE CHANGE POSITION STATEMENT AND ACTION PLAN

12

Supporting customers’ transition to net-zero and to buildtheir climate resilience (continued)



Reduce our portfoliofinanced emissionsAluminium1 Target: 10.35 tCO2-e / t aluminium for scope 1 and 2 by 2030.

Key transition actions:

— Where possible, provide financing for transition activitiesand technologies, including projects to developinfrastructure required for low emissions production,support customers with projects and activities that willcontribute to wider decarbonisation in the economy andto assist with reduction of customer emissions intensity

— Engage with customers as they develop their emissionsreduction plans

Transport – Aviation(passenger aircraftoperators 2 )

Target: 76.4 gCO2-e/passenger km for scope 1 by 20303



Key transition actions:

— Provide financing for activities and technologies thatsupport customers to reduce their emissions, for exampleSustainable Aviation Fuels procurement or development

— Manage our portfolio and seek to onboard newcustomers, prioritising companies with strongerdecarbonisation commitments

— Engage with customers as they develop their emissionsreduction plans, focusing our engagement onopportunities for fuel efficiency and key technologies

Agriculture (Australia) 4 Targets:

Dairy: 10% reduction in scope 1 land management 5 emissionsintensity (tCO2-e/tonne of FPCM 6 ) by 2030 from a 2021baseline

Beef and sheep: 9% reduction in scope 1 land managementemissions intensity (tCO2-e/tonne of FW 7 ) by 2030 from a2021 baselineAs part of our Agriculture targets, we are committed to nodeforestation, which provides for no further conversion ofnatural forest 8 to agricultural land use within farm systemsfrom 31 December 2025 for customers in scope of thetargets

Key transition actions:

— Engage with industry groups and representatives toidentify collaboration opportunities such as support andinvestment in emissions reduction technology and datacapture

1 Scope 1 and 2 emissions for alumina refining and aluminium smelting on an emissions intensity basis. Tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2 -e) pertonne of primary aluminium produced per annum.2 Covers customers that operate scheduled air transport for passengers, including freight operations undertaken by passenger airline operators. We haveexcluded any freight only operators, rotary wing aircraft, non-scheduled aircraft operations and aircraft lessors.3 Passenger kilometres (pkm) is a measure of activity for passenger airline operators.4 Applies to institutional and commercial relationship-managed Agribusiness customers with Total Committed Exposures (TCE) ≥ $1.5m who are capturedby dairy, beef, sheep and mixed farming ANZSIC codes.5 Land management emissions refers to operational emissions resulting from how land is managed rather than emissions resulting from land-use change.Land management emissions arise from processes such as enteric fermentation, biomass burning and fertiliser use.6 Fat protein corrected milk (FPCM) is a commonly used measure of dairy farm outputs. FPCM is milk corrected for its fat and protein content to a regionalstandard. In the Science Based Target initiative Forest, Land and Agriculture Guidance (SBTi FLAG), reference scenario we used for setting Agriculturetargets, dairy production is expressed in tonnes of FPCM.7 In the SBTi FLAG tool interface animal commodities are expressed in tonnes of fresh weight (FW) of carcass where carcass is defined as animal meat,fresh, chilled or frozen, with bone.8 A forest that is a natural ecosystem, possessing many or most of the characteristics of a forest native to the given site, including species composition,structure, and ecological function. Natural forests include: (i) Primary forest that have been subject to major human impacts in recent history. (ii)Regenerated forest that were subject to major impacts in the past (for instance by agriculture, livestock raising, tree plantations, or intensive logging)but where the main causes of impact have ceased or greatly diminished and the ecosystem has attained structure, function and composition of a naturalforest. (iii) Managed natural forests where much of the ecosystem’s composition, structure, and ecological function exist in the presence of activitiessuch as harvesting of timber or small-scale cultivation. (iv) Forests that have been partially degraded by anthropogenic or natural causes (e.g. harvesting,fire, climate change, invasive species, or others) but where the land has not been converted to another use and where degradation does not result in thesustained reduction of tree cover below the thresholds that define a forest or loss in structure, function or composition. The categories “natural forest”and “tree plantation” are mutually exclusive, though in some cases the distinction may be nuanced. Source: Accountability Framework Initiative.
