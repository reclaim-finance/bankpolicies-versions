3Standard Chartered Net zero approach



I. Introduction



This paper describes our approach to net zero.It lays out the methodology we have used tocalculate our emissions and to set our emissionsreduction targets at sector level. It alsodescribes the challenges and choices we havefaced, and how we have chosen to resolve them.

Our approach reflects our belief that climatechange is one of the greatest challenges facingthe world today, and that its impact will hithardest in the markets where we operate. Manyof these are currently reliant on carbon-intensiveindustries for their continued economic growth.

Achieving a just transition – one whereclimate objectives are met without deprivingdeveloping countries of their opportunity togrow and prosper – will require capital andspecialised support. We are uniquely placed tohelp by directing capital to markets that haveboth the greatest opportunity to adopt low-carbon technology, and some of the toughesttransition-financing and climate challenges.

We hope that by setting out this methodologytransparently, we can encourage discussion,engagement, and debate. We welcomecomments and input, and would invite otherfinancial institutions operating in similar marketsto use this methodology to help shape their ownapproach.

I.I. Methodology

Our methodology builds on global standards,including those set by the Science BasedTarget initiative (SBTi), the Net Zero BankingAlliance (NZBA) and the Partnership forCarbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). We havealso drawn upon Boston Consulting Group’sclimate, industrial sector and statistical specificcapabilities, and Baringa Partners’ climate,technical and modelling capabilities.

Where necessary, we have adapted ourmethodology to meet the following challengespresented by our footprint markets:



• Lack of client greenhouse gas (GHG) data:

Many of our clients do not yet measuretheir own emissions. As such we havesupplemented this with estimates of clientemissions based on statistical regressionanalysis at sector level. We expect datato improve over time and we intend tointegrate it as it becomes available.

• Lack of scenario granularity: We use twodifferent global scenarios to assess theevolution of emissions up to 2050. Thesescenarios are derived from the IEA’s NetZero Emissions by 2050 scenario (NZE) andCurrent Policies Scenario (CPS). However,the IEA global scenarios are not sufficientlygranular for detailed portfolio analysis. Wehave, therefore, augmented these datasetswith a range of data sources that considerthe specific pathways for our markets,consistent with reaching net zero by 2050.

I.II. Targets

As a starting point, we measured the absolutefinanced emissions baseline of our corporatelending portfolio as of 2020-year end, focusingon USD74.8 billion of assets (equating to acoverage of 77 per cent of our in-scope assetsof USD97.3 billion), equal to 45.2 million metrictonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (45.2MtCO2e). There is currently insufficient availabledata to accurately reflect the financedemissions of the remaining 23 per cent ofour in-scope assets. A linear extrapolationwould translate to an overall baseline of upto approximately 59Mt CO2e. Our view of thebaseline estimate will be progressively refinedas data availability and quality improves.

Further to calculating our baseline emissions, wehave also set targets for our highest-emittingsectors, i.e. Oil and Gas, Metals and Mining,and Power. We have set our 2030 targets usingeconomic emissions intensity in all cases, apartfrom the Coal Mining\* subsector, where we haveset absolute emissions targets. Our approach andcalculations are set out in the document below.

\*Unless otherwise stated, ‘Coal Mining’ in this document refers to thermal coal mining

These sectors represent approximately 62.5 percent of our overall absolute financed emissionsbaseline. Figure 1 provides an overview offinanced emissions and assets in scope bysector. The data coverage in these sectors ishigher than the average across the portfolio.

Figure 1 – Total financed emissions by sector

For each of the sectors, we have establishedthe following:



• Baseline: From an absolute financedemissions perspective, our 2020 year-endtotal baseline was 45.2MtCO2e, associatedwith USD74.8 billion in-scope assets.This is our best estimate based on ourinterpretation of standards and availabledata and methodologies. We stateassumptions and limitations associated withour approach in this paper. As standardsand methodologies evolve, and data qualityand availability improves, we will continue torefine our emissions calculations further.

• Projections: We have projected the evolutionof financed emissions up to 2050 usingtwo different global scenarios, to capturethe different outcomes between a net zeroand 3.5°C world. The gap between thesescenarios then provides an initial measureof the decarbonisation challenge, which isfurther refined at a client level by assessingindividual decarbonisation commitmentsand transition risk mitigation plans.



• Target setting: For each of the three sectorswe have defined emissions reduction targetsthat are aligned with our ambition to realisenet zero financed emissions by 2050 (seeFigure 2). In line with the baseline, we havedrawn upon two main target metrics forour commitment. For all sectors except coal

mining, we have opted for revenue-basedcarbon intensity reduction targets, insteadof absolute emissions. We have chosenthese targets to better reflect the economicprofile of our footprint, which covers manylow-income emerging markets that requiresignificant capital flows to support theireconomic growth and development. As theNZE scenario makes clear, this will in part bebased on an increased share of global oiland gas production. Further to which, thereis the requirement to finance the improvedtechnologies in these industries, as well asthe sustainable solutions that will allow thesemarkets to transition away from fossil fuels.Both continued economic growth and a shifttowards renewables are key components ofthe just transition.

• For the coal-mining sector, we have adoptedabsolute financed emissions reductiontargets, recognising the need for a phase outof all thermal-coal-related activities and thegrowing availability of alternatives to coale.g. renewables. However, the same cannotbe said for oil and gas, where renewablesolutions are far less advanced.

• Achieving these targets assumes acombination of levers, including supportingclients with transition and green financing,assessing exposure to emission-intensiveclients or assets that are not on a pathto align with our goals, and adding newsustainable clients to our portfolio, especiallythose clients in emerging markets that areadopting low-carbon business models.

• Our commitment to support growth in ourmarkets, and to provide our clients withtransition finance, means that, while ouremissions intensity reduction targets arealigned to a net zero pathway, our absolutefinanced emissions may increase over thenext few years before reducing in line withour net zero targets.

• Enhancement: Baseline, projections and netzero targets may be refined, adjusted andrestated over time as data coverage andgranularity improve, emissions scenariosevolve, external policy and regulatoryenvironments expand, industry standardsdevelop and industry circumstances unfoldbeyond our control.

1\. Baseline



The baseline was measured at a single clientand portfolio level using two metrics, bothaligned with the PCAF measurement standard:



• Revenue-based carbon intensity1: ameasurement of the quantity of GHGemitted by our clients per USD of theirrevenue

• Absolute financed emissions:

a measurement of our attributed shareof clients’ GHG emissions

The lack of production data at the clientlevel, particularly in emerging markets, limitsour ability to use a production-based carbonintensity baseline. As client revenue data is morereadily available, it was deemed to providethe best trade-off between data availabilityand calculation accuracy. We aim to engagewith clients to collect production and emissionsdata of a granularity that would support aproduction-based carbon intensity baseline.

Revenue-based carbon intensity allows ahomogeneous measurement between clientsand sectors, for example upstream, midstream,or downstream oil companies which may havedifferent emissions profiles. It is also applicableto specific sub-sectors where it is harder to linkindustrial activity to production figures, such asoil and gas shipping companies.

There are potential limitations related to thisapproach, for example, short-term fluctuationsof commodity prices, and therefore revenues,can lead to carbon intensity volatility.

Our aim is to report production-based carbonintensity as the availability and quality ofdata improves.

Revenue-based carbon intensity



At a single client level, revenue-based carbon intensity is computed as:

Equation 1 – Calculation formula for revenue-based carbon intensity at client level

At a portfolio level, revenue-based carbon intensity is computed as:

Equation 2 – Calculation formula for revenue-based carbon intensity at portfolio level

Where:• ‘i’ stands for one specific client and the summation is performed across all clients ina given portfolio• ‘EVIC’ stands for enterprise value including cash

Worked example for revenue-based carbon intensity at portfolio level

The following worked example illustrates the use of the above formula in calculating the revenue-based carbon intensity at sector/portfolio level given three sample clients in the sector/portfolio:

• Client-specific measures are needed to compute revenue-base carbon intensity: (A)outstanding exposure, (B) EVIC, (C) revenue, and (D) total GHG emissions.

• For each client we calculate (E) financed emissions (see Equation 3)

• We calculate (F) attributed revenue for each client as the ratio of (A) outstanding exposureover (B) EVIC, multiplied by (C) revenue

• As outlined in Equation 2, the ratio of the sum of (E) financed emissions over the sum of (F)attributed revenue is the (G) revenue-based carbon intensity (i.e. 0.05 kgCO2e/USD)

1.1. Baseline input data,sources, and enhancements

When considering a client’s outstandingexposure, the PCAF standards recommend usingthe “follow the money” principle, to understandand account for the climate impact in the realeconomy. We have included the outstandingbalance sheet exposure at 2020 year-end,as well as corporate bonds held for financingpurposes2. Undrawn commitments and productsin the corporate lending portfolio that do notcontribute to our on-balance-sheet exposure(e.g. letters of credit) are not considered.

A client’s EVIC is measured as follows:

• Listed companies: as the sum of marketcapitalisation and book value of total debt(in line with PCAF, no deductions to accountfor cash have been performed)

• Private companies: as the sum of book valueof total equity and book value of total debt

Even though the market capitalisation of listedcompanies could be impacted by stock pricefluctuations, and therefore introduce volatilityin our measurement of financed emissions, wehave decided to use the 2020 year-end value forcomputation of EVIC since:

• It is aligned with the PCAF3 standard andsupports comparability with peers

• Movement in medium and long-termmarket capitalisation are typically linkedto fundamental changes in a company’sbusiness activity. Such trends should bereflected in our attributed share of emissions

Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions have beenincluded for each of our three industry sectors.Scope 3 GHG emissions have been measuredfor the Oil and Gas sector and Coal Miningsubsector, since reducing the combustionof their product is key to reaching net zerotargets. Coverage of Scope 3 GHG emissions foradditional sectors will be evaluated in future asstandards develop.



Absolute financed emissions



At a single client level, absolute financed emissions are computed as:

Equation 3 – Calculation formula for absolute financed emissions at client level

At a portfolio level, absolute financed emissions are computed as:

Equation 4 – Calculation formula for absolute financed emissions at portfolio level

Where ‘i’ stands for one specific client and the summation is performed across all clients ina given portfolio.

We have sourced clients’ GHG emissions froma third-party database4. This information wasavailable for approximately 61 per cent of theoutstanding exposure in scope of the baseline.Where this information was not available,clients’ GHG emissions were estimated usinga statistical regression analysis of emissionsagainst client revenue at sector level.

1.2. Quality control checks

We have undertaken an extensive review andchallenge process to verify the output of ourbaselining methodology5.

This process focused on two key aspects:



• Data taxonomy: we reviewed the internalindustry sector classification6 of eachapplicable client. In some cases, clientswere excluded from the regressions asthe underlying business activity was notaligned with that of the overall sector and,therefore, not consistent with the sector’srevenue-based carbon intensity (e.g. wehave excluded commodity trading facilitiesclassified within the Metals and Miningsector).



• Regression analysis: we reviewed andchallenged the regression analysis. First, weaugmented the data to include all emissionsdata points available from the third-partydata provider for a given sector (i.e. notlimited to data points from our clients).The accuracy of the regression results wasthen tested with a challenger model, whichre-performed all the regressions using analternative dataset. The analysis resultedin a typical error margin up to about 15 percent on sectors in scope on a revenue-basedcarbon metric. This was deemed acceptabledue to variations in taxonomy and clientbase between databases.

This process leveraged sector and statistical expertise providedby Boston Consulting Group.6\. The client-by-client review was performed with a dedicatedfocus on our priority sectors.

2\. Projections



We have utilised two global projection scenariosfor the timeframe 2020 to 2050, to capture therange of outcomes that a net zero and a 3.5°Cworld would bring.

While NZE has external recognition, it lacksthe appropriate level of regional and sectoralcoverage required for our footprint. We havetherefore enhanced this scenario, as detailedin the Annex, to create the Augmented NZEscenario. This defines a target pathway forour portfolio that is consistent with reachingnet zero by 2050. The augmentation processenables us to:

• Determine results for some individual sectorsmissing from NZE

• Determine pathways for 12 regions

• Represent results for other GHG

• Include full results for intervening years 2025,2035 and 2045 for each sector and region.

The gap between the 3.5°C and AugmentedNZE scenarios provides an initial measureof the decarbonisation challenge. For ourkey exposures in high emitting sectors, weconsidered our client’s decarbonisationcommitments and transition risk mitigationplans to reduce the gap to target.

Baringa Partners’ Augmented NZE scenario is anenhancement of the IEA’s NZE, published in May2021, which is consistent with global warming of1.5°C by 2100 with 50 per cent probability7. TheNZE aims to ensure that energy-related andindustrial process CO2 emissions to 2030 are inline with reductions in 1.5°C scenarios with no,low or limited temperature overshoot assessedby the Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange (IPCC) in its Special Report on GlobalWarming of 1.5°C.

Baringa Partners derived the 3.5°C scenariofrom the IEA’s CPS, which captures existinggovernment policies and trends worldwide,aligned to a global warming of 3.5°C by 2100with 50 per cent probability. It assumes thereis no action taken globally beyond policiesthat have been enacted and trends alreadyin evidence as of November 2019, before theCOVID-19 pandemic took hold.

2.1. Methodology for sectorprojections – Scope 1

The global scenarios show results for Scope 1emissions at source, i.e. where they are physicallyreleased. As the IEA only publishes limiteddata for each scenario, the next step was toexpand the level of detail, so we obtained afully developed global scenario including resultsfor individual regions and sectors, at five-yearintervals from 2020 to 2050. We then mappedour portfolio to these regions and sectors foreach of these years.

In the Augmented NZE scenario, all regionstrend towards zero emissions, with emergingmarkets decarbonising more gradually thanadvanced economies as a result of their strongereconomic growth and the fact that they arestarting from a lower emissions reductionstarting point. In the 3.5°C scenario, mostregions show flat or increasing emissions overtime. The resulting projections for absolute CO2emissions in the two scenarios, at the regionallevel, are shown in Figure 4.

2.2. Methodology for sectorprojections – Scope 2 andScope 3

For reporting and target-setting purposes, inaddition to Scope 1, it is also necessary to projectour clients’ Scope 2 (power-related) and Scope 3(upstream and downstream) GHG emissions. Bytheir very nature, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissionsinvolve double-counting: the power sector’semissions are counted a second time whenthey are attributed to the electricity consumeras Scope 2; and Scope 3 emissions are countedupstream and/or downstream as well as at theemissions source.

In both scenarios, Scope 2 emissions areprojected using the power sector pathways forthe specific type of power generation (industry,transport, or building). Scope 3 emissions areprojected based on production trends for oil,gas, and coal. Scope 3 is determined by the CO2embedded in the fossil fuel produced, whichassumes that all the fuel is combusted andignores the impact of carbon capture, utilisation,and storage (CCUS).



2.3. EVIC evolution

The estimate of portfolio-level financedemissions is based on our share of financingat an individual client level, where our share isdetermined by the ratio of our exposure to theclient in relation to their EVIC.

The growth in emissions in the 3.5°C scenariosare the result of increased economic activity.This has the adverse effect of growing ourmeasure of financed emissions, even though ourexposure to the client remains constant. As theeconomic activity of a company is increasing, ascan be evidenced from its emissions, the valueshould likewise grow (i.e. through the EVIC).Evolving the EVIC in this way would naturallyflatten our share of financed emissions.

While the current standards or scenarios do notprovide direct guidance on how the EVIC of aclient is expected to change over time, we havemodelled EVIC in line with growth (or decline)in production or equivalent trends in respectivesectors and regions.

To evolve EVIC at the client level, we haveutilised the sectoral and regional productiontrends from the 3.5°C scenario to evolve eachcompany’s EVIC. While production levels in

some industries are expected to decrease overtime in the NZE scenario, it is assumed thatcompanies in those sectors, such as Oil andGas, will manage to retain their EVIC due to ashift in their business models to more efficienttechnologies. It may be possible to further refinethis approach to consider variations acrosssectors and apply these to the underlyingcompany trajectories.

2.4. Client-level transitionpathways

Sectoral emissions trajectories have beenapplied to individual clients, starting from theyear-end 2020 baseline, to form a view of client-level financed emissions in the two scenarios.

The gap between the 3.5°C and AugmentedNZE scenario trajectories measures theemissions reductions our clients need to enactto meet net zero ambitions, for clients thatare currently on a 3.5°C trajectory. We haveapplied the same Standard Chartered exposurelevels for both scenarios. We expect this gapto be reduced over time as the result of ourclients’ decarbonisation efforts. In order toform a more accurate view of the client-leveltransition required, and the support thatwe would need to provide to our clients, wehave taken into account their latest publiclystated commitments, as well as information ontheir transition risk mitigation plans gatheredfrom our engagement with them.

We have used this information to create a rangeof ‘gap to target’ trajectories at the overallportfolio level:

• Conservative trajectory: considering eachclient’s publicly stated commitments,if available, and only where they havean average or better than average transitionrisk mitigation plan (see Annex for detail)

• Commitment trajectory: considering eachclient’s publicly stated commitments, ifavailable, without any further adjustmentto the status of their transition riskmitigation plans

• Optimistic trajectory: considering eachclient’s publicly stated commitments, asper the ‘Commitment trajectory’. This alsoassumes a 2°C trajectory for clients whohave not made a public commitment butwho have stated an intention to align to theParis Agreement through our engagement

Clients who do not meet these criteria, withrespect to public commitment, mitigation plan,or stated intention, are assumed to align tothe relevant sectoral 3.5°C trajectory.

With increasing engagement and clientcommitment to transition planning, we expectthe gap between our clients’ pathways andAugmented NZE trajectory to reduce over time.

2.5. Quality control checks

For the 3.5°C scenario, we have applied IEA CPSinput assumptions. The quality control exercisedby the IEA in its World Energy Outlook has beenimplicitly translated to the 3.5°C scenario. Wehave carried out detailed comparisons to ensurewe understand any material differences. Ofparticular importance, the cumulative globalCO2 emissions between 2020 and 2040 differby just 6 per cent between the 3.5°C and CPSscenarios. In summary, we are comfortable thatthe 3.5°C scenario materially aligns withIEA’s CPS.

13Standard Chartered Net zero approach



3\. Target setting



For the first wave of net zero targets, we haveprioritised our highest emitting sectors: Oil andGas, Metals and Mining, and Power. Collectively,these account for approximately 62.5 per cent ofour emissions baseline.

We have used two metrics for our targets:absolute financed emissions and revenue-basedcarbon intensity. For all sectors except CoalMining, we have opted for revenue-based carbonintensity reduction targets to allow for futuregrowth in emerging markets, and to supportour clients on their journey to decarbonise byproviding transition finance. We have adoptedabsolute financed emissions reductions for theCoal Mining subsector recognising the need fora phase out of all thermal coal-related activitiesand the growing availability of alternatives tocoal, especially renewables. This is in contrast tooil and gas, where there are still fewer sustainablealternatives.

We have identified three specific levers to helpto achieve our net zero targets:



• Providing our clients with transition andgreen financing: Supporting our clients ontheir decarbonisation journey through theprovision of transition finance and expertadvice is, and will continue to be, at the heartof our approach. This is essential in emergingmarkets to ensure continued economic andsocial development and to help drive a justtransition. Without such support companieswill struggle to scale-up transitiontechnologies at the required rate.



• Assessing exposure to emission intensiveclients and/or assets: We continue toengage with our clients to better understandtheir transition plans. This will allow usto assess and balance both their intentand ability to transition to lower emissiontechnologies. In some cases, particularlyfor the highest emitters, we may need toreassess the extent of our relationship.



• Adding new low carbon intensity clients toour portfolio: As part of our journey to netzero, we will be looking to engage with andpromote companies who are at the forefrontof solving the technical challenges of a low-carbon economy.



Approach to transition finance

We define transition finance as any financialservices provided to clients to support themalign their business and/or operations witha 1.5°C trajectory.8

To operationalise our net zero commitment,we have developed a Transition FinanceFramework9 that will act as an eligibilityguide, informing which assets we can label as‘transition’. The Framework will help acceleratethe flow of capital to decarbonisation activities,our clients to net zero by 2050, and in turnreduce our financed emissions.

In the absence of a current global consensuson labelling economic activities as ‘transition’we have aligned our Framework with NZEand have followed the principles laid outby the Climate Bonds Initiative and the EUTaxonomy. As technologies and science-basedscenarios evolve, we will evolve our Frameworkaccordingly.

We have also developed a dedicatedmethodology to measure client emissions. Thisapproach allows us to understand and measurethe impact on driving reduced emissions bysupporting transition activity. This in turnreduces the overall carbon intensity for therelevant client exposures.

In each of our high emitting sectors, we haveidentified sector specific and cross-cuttingtransition technologies that we expect will playa major role in decarbonisation. For example, inthe first wave of sectors:



• Oil and Gas: biofuels, CCUS, hydrogen,offshore wind, onshore wind, solarphotovoltaics (PV), charging infrastructure

8\. Our definition is a starting point and we acknowledge that it will need to adapt and change given the speed at which science-basedscenarios, consensus on best practice and regulations are changing9\. Standard Chartered Transition Finance Framework

14Standard Chartered Net zero approach

• Metals and Mining: CCUS, switch torenewables, direct reduced iron and electricarc furnaces (DRI-EAF), increased use ofscrap for secondary steel production, miningelectrification, hydrogen, coal mine methanecapture



• Power: CCUS, hydrogen, grid expansion,nuclear, stationary batteries, offshorewind, onshore wind, solar PV, charginginfrastructure.

For each technology, we have computed therevenue-based carbon intensity based onEquation 5:



• Annual funding that will be provided byStandard Chartered



• Investment required, to generate onenominal unit of production capacity



• Capacity factor, which represents the shareof actual usage of nominal productioncapacity



• Emissions factor, as a measure of theGHG emissions attributable to each unit ofproduction capacity



• Revenues of the technology, based on theactual production of the technology (annualfunding divided by overnight costs multipliedcapacity factor) multiplied by the averageprice per unit of output



3.1. Our approach to carboncredits

Currently, standards, such as the Science BasedTargets initiative (SBTi), do not mandatecompanies to adopt high ambition pathwaysto net zero10, nor do they enable companies toaccount for carbon credits as part of emissionsbaselines or progress towards net zero targets.However, this is an area of considerable ongoingwork. We recognise the potential of highquality carbon credits to direct funds to criticalemissions avoidance, reduction and removalprojects, and therefore would like our clientsto report (alongside their gross emissions) anycarbon credits they purchase and retire, withdetails of what those carbon credits are.

Recognising the critical role of high qualitycarbon credits in addressing the climatechallenge, we intend to compensate forresidual operating emissions in our own netzero trajectory. Moreover, we want to recogniseclients who take similar action, over and abovedirect emissions reductions on their respectivenet zero pathways, creating the right incentivesfor them to invest in projects that supportthe goals of the Paris Agreement. We planto develop and embed a framework for thisrecognition and incentivisation in 2022.

Current carbon credit standards do notguarantee that quality is as high as possible,which is why we support the goals of theTaskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Marketsto develop a set of Core Carbon Principles(CCPs) that will allow the development ofconsistently high-quality carbon credits. Our aimis that any carbon credit that we sell to clients isof the highest quality and integrity, in line withthe CCPs.

15Standard Chartered Net zero approach



The rapid evolution of the standards tomeasure emissions, the improvement of datacoverage and data granularity, the expansionof external policy and regulatory environments,the development of industry standards andindustry circumstances that unfold beyondour control mean that, we expect, over time,changes to our approach and targets will berequired to address this evolution. Accordingly,a key aspect of our methodology is a periodicenhancement of the inputs and assumptions,aimed at challenging and continually evolvingthe emissions reduction targets.

This process will be driven by the following factors:



Methodology evolution: PCAF and otherstandards might evolve to widen the coverageof in-scope products from the currenton-balance-sheet exposures. These wouldinclude, among others, off-balance-sheetobligations and arrangement of capitalmarkets products (both debt and equity). Themethodology would likely evolve to adoptdifferent approaches for these various productsand to that extent, we intend to adapt ourmeasurement approach to align with theevolving methodology.



Improvement in data quality: We expect thatthe availability and reliability of external dataon emissions will improve over time, in line withthe wider adoption of climate-reporting byclients, e.g. the Taskforce on Climate-RelatedFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) and CarbonDisclosure Project (CDP) questionnaires. Wewill continue to gather our clients’ emissionsdata and track their progress in line with statedcommitments.



Evolution of the metrics: Over and above therevenue-based emissions intensity, we wouldexpect our choice of metrics to evolve to includeproduction-based carbon intensity as anadditional metric. To enable such an approach,we plan to assess and integrate productiondata as they become available more widelyin our markets.



Asset level emissions measurement: A key tenetof the transition finance approach is to measureand monitor emissions at an asset level wherethere is ‘ring-fencing’ of use of proceeds and/orcontractual arrangements to monitor the use ofproceeds for the intended transition technologyor project. We will therefore aim to work withindustry bodies to develop and evolve themethodology, which allows for an acceptableapproach to measuring and tracking theemissions linked to transition finance.



Changes in emissions scenarios: Scenariossuch as NZE are likely to be updated over time,to reflect changes in the energy picture (forexample technologies or policies) and currentglobal, as well as regional/country-level, energyand emissions trends with increased sectoralcoverage. Subsequent updates may thereforelead to changes in the required projections,which may then necessitate updating ourportfolio targets.



4\. Future enhancements

16Standard Chartered Net zero approach



5\. Sector deep-dives



We have conducted deep dives into our threehighest emitting sectors: Oil and Gas, Metalsand Mining, and Power. Our methodology forthe baseline, projections, and target setting isdescribed below.

5.1. Oil and Gas

The Oil and Gas sector plays a central role inglobal efforts to decarbonise, with several of ourclients having already made decarbonisationcommitments, most with carbon intensitytargets for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

Industry efforts to decarbonise are currentlysupported by switching to gas, biofuels,hydrogen, and renewables, as well as leveragingtechnologies such as CCUS and other emissionsabatement projects.

The decarbonisation of the Oil and Gas sectoris particularly relevant for our footprint, witharound 50 per cent of the sector’s globalemissions originating in Asia, Africa, and theMiddle East11. The NZE scenario predicts thatbetween 2020 and 2030, emerging markets willgrow their market share of both global oil andgas production from 47 per cent to 50 per centand from 38 per cent to 44 per cent, respectively.However, over the next five years, andspecifically in our geographical footprint, whileactual gas production is projected to increaseby 15 per cent, oil is expected to decrease by6 per cent.



5.1.1. Baseline

We have categorised clients according to threesubsectors, taking into account their primarybusiness activities:



• Oil and Gas companies (for exampleinternational/national oil companies,independent oil and gas companies,midstream and downstream companies)



• Oil and Gas service companies (for exampleengineering/construction companies, oilfield services, oil and gas shipping)



• Other Oil and Gas companies (for examplefinancial sponsors, private equity and hedgefunds, oil and gas traders)

For Scope 1 and 2, a baseline was computed forall three subsectors. For Scope 3, a baseline hasbeen computed only for Oil and Gas companies.The other two subsectors were excludedfrom Scope 3 emissions computation, as theunderlying business activity does not implyactual production of fossil fuels.



5.1.2. Projections

In the 3.5°C scenario, economic growth is stillunderpinned by fossil fuels throughout thetimeframe, with oil demand increasing roughly10 per cent and gas demand 75 per centbetween 2020 and 2050.

In NZE, the share of fossil fuels in global energyfalls from around 80 per cent in 2020 to 20 percent in 2050, and the residual usage of fossilfuels by 2050 is primarily related to goodswhere carbon is embedded (e.g. plastics),or production facilities fitted with CCUS. Anyremaining usage of fossil fuels is limited tosectors where low-emissions technologyoptions are scarce.

These emissions are not reported separately bythe IEA in NZE, so for our Augmented NZE 2050scenario, we have used the emission projectionsfrom the Orderly Paris scenario results providedby Baringa Partners (BOP) (additional detailsprovided in the Annex, Section 7.2).

As described in Section 2.2, Scope 2 emissionsare projected using the power generationemissions pathway.

Scope 3 downstream emissions make up around90 per cent of total emissions in the Oil and Gassector. As described in Section 2.2, projectionsfor Scope 3 have been calculated assuming thatall fuel is burned and no impact from CCUS.

Figure 5 shows revenue-based carbon intensityfor the oil and gas portfolio under both scenariosand highlights the need for the sector to reducecarbon intensity by 30 per cent by 2030.

Figure 5 - Carbon intensity for Oil and Gasby scenario



5.1.3. Target setting

For this sector, we are setting targets onlyfor Oil and Gas companies and Oil and Gasservice companies (excluding Other Oil andGas companies). In line with SBTi guidance, therevenue-based carbon intensity target coversmore than 95 per cent of our current in-scopefinancing exposure. Over time, we intend to shiftto absolute emissions reduction targets for theOil and Gas sector.



Oil and Gas target: 30 per cent reduction inrevenue-based carbon intensity of our portfoliofrom 2020 to 2030 (from 3.02 to 2.12 kgCO2e/USD client revenue).

Targets related to Oil and Gas are supportedby our public Oil and Gas position statementeffective from March 202212.

For the Oil and Gas industry, the possibletransition pathway includes:

• Reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions throughemissions reduction technologies such asgas flare down, methane monitoring and

abatements. In the longer term, technologieslike hydrogen and leveraging CCUS will alsohelp curb emissions

• Reducing Scope 3 emissions will be moredependent on technologies that improveend use efficiency, such as more fuel-efficientcars or planes, or reduced use of fossil fuels inheating and power (for example leveragingrenewables or biofuels as a replacement).

5.2. Metals and Mining

The Metals and Mining sector provides rawmaterials that supports much of the globaleconomy. This includes those materialsrequired for building and scaling clean energytechnologies at the rate required in NZE. Forexample, lithium is used in electric vehicle(EV) batteries, rare earth metals are used forEV motors and wind turbines, and platinum isutilised as a catalyst in hydrogen fuel cells. Thesector contributes around 12 per cent13 of globalCO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2), of which Asia,Africa and the Middle East contribute more than75 per cent14.

Structural changes in demand, combined withfinancial and regulatory pressure, are drivingincreased awareness of the need for companiesin this sector to decarbonise operations. Manyof our clients have already made net zerocommitments and we are working with themto reduce their emissions through financingtransition technologies such as DRI-EAF, CCUS,and electrification or fuel switching.



5.2.1. Baseline

We will seek to categorise clients according tofive subsectors, taking into account their primarybusiness activities:



• Coal Mining: upstream extraction of thermalcoal



• Mining (excluding thermal coal): upstreamextraction of minerals/metal ores other thanthermal coal (e.g. iron ore, bauxite, silver ore,metallurgical coal)

• Steel Producers: mid-stream productionof steel from iron ore (e.g. via blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) or electric arcfurnace (EAF) processes)



• Aluminium Producers: mid-streamproduction of alumina/aluminium frombauxite (e.g. via Bayer and Hall Heroultprocesses)



• Other Metals and Mining clients: metalsprocessors15, other metal producers16, metalstraders17, mining support services18

For Scope 1 and 2, a baseline was computedfor all subsectors. For Scope 3, a baseline hasbeen computed only for Coal Mining due tosignificant end use emissions associated withpower generation using thermal coal. We arenot setting targets for Aluminium Producers andOther Metals and Mining clients at this stage,while specific pathways for these sectors arebeing developed.



5.2.2. Projections

Mining projections

For the Coal Mining subsector, NZE assumes nonew unabated coal plants, new coal mines ormine extensions as of 2021. The least efficientcoal plants are phased out by 2030 and allremaining coal plants in use are retrofitted by2040\. All unabated coal demand declines by98 per cent to less than 1 per cent of total energyuse in 2050. In contrast, in the 3.5°C scenario,coal production grows by 10 to 15 per cent,depending on the region, over the 2020-2050timeframe.

Scope 1 emissions from coal production havebeen determined by applying the specificsectoral results from the BOP scenario.

Scope 2 emissions follow the trend for PowerGeneration.

Scope 3 absolute emissions are based on coalproduction. NZE provides data on global coalproduction over the timeframe, and thereforethis global total is not split by advanced

economies and emerging markets. Scope 3absolute emissions trajectories are shown inFigure 6.

Figure 6 – Scope 3 emissions for coal productionby scenario

For Mining (excluding thermal coal), NZEstipulates that ‘Other Industry’ also includesother minerals and metals. We have thereforedetermined Scope 1 pathways based on ‘OtherIndustry’ data from NZE which is only availableat the advanced economies and emergingmarkets level. For this subsector, we plan toupdate our target when a tailored miningpathway is available from NZE.



Steel Producer projections

In the NZE scenario we see a sustained increasein demand for steel, to support the expansionof energy-related infrastructure. Despite thisincrease in demand, there is a significantreduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions, which isdriven by technological innovation. Almost60 per cent of emissions reduction in heavyindustry is achieved by using technologiesunder development today such as CCUS andhydrogen. The widespread use of EAF after2040 assumes a phase-out of coking coal whichwill drive down global sectoral emissions toclose to zero.

Emissions for this sector are often quotedor published in a way that partially includesScope 2 and/or Scope 3. In our methodology,we differentiate Scope 1 from Scope 2 and 3 to

15\. Downstream processing of metal/metal products (e.g. rolling, extrusion, recycling, die-casting)16\. Mid-stream production of metals that are not steel or aluminium (e.g. copper, tin, gold)17\.

support clearer and more precise calculations.We are not yet including Scope 3 emissionsfor the steel sector because of sparse dataavailability and lack of clarity on upstream/downstream delineation. We continue toengage with our clients and standard settersto develop a suitable approach to calculatingScope 3 emissions for steel.



5.2.3. Target setting

For Metals and Mining we are setting targetsonly for Mining (excluding Coal), Coal Miningand Steel Producers. We plan to release targetsfor Aluminium Producers and Other Metals andMining clients when dedicated pathways forthe sectors have been developed. In line withSBTi guidance, the Coal Mining target coversmore than 95 per cent of our current in-scopefinancing exposure.

Targets related to Metals and Mining aresupported by our public extractive industriesposition statement effective from March 2022.19



Mining targets

Mining (excluding thermal coal): 33 per centreduction in revenue-based carbon intensity ofour portfolio from 2020 to 2030 (from 0.95 to0.63kgCO2e/USD of client revenue)

Coal Mining: 85 per cent reduction in absolutefinanced emissions of our portfolio from 2020 to2030 (from 3.34 to 0.50 MtCO2e)

Based just on the NZE pathway, the minimumabsolute financed emissions reduction of ourportfolio would need to be 53 per cent. However,considering our public extractive industriesposition statement, we have set an absolutefinanced emissions reduction target goingbeyond this requirement for the small number ofclients in our portfolio directly engaged in thermalcoal mining activities.20

For the mining industry, the possible transitionpathway includes:

• Addressing Scope 1 and 2 emissionsthrough the scale up of renewables andelectrification/fuel switch in upstream

operations, leading to short-term emissionsreduction as well as potential improvementof energy-related operational expenditure

• Continuing divestment from thermal coalmining activities and structural portfolioreshaping in line with global thermal coalphase-out

• Tackling Scope 3 emissions via downstreamcooperation across the value chain (e.g.scaling up green steel production facilities).



Steel Producers targets

Steel Producers: 33 per cent reduction inrevenue-based carbon intensity of our portfoliofrom 2020 to 2030 (from 2.16 to 1.45kgCO2e/USD of client revenue)

For the steel industry, the possible transitionpathway includes:

• Increased use of scrap and use of naturalgas for virgin steel production arealready mature technologies that presentdecarbonisation opportunities over the nextfive to 10 years

• Hydrogen (through the DRI-EAF process)and CCUS are longer-term solutions

5.3. Power

The Power sector sits at the forefront of theenergy transition. Renewables with technologiessuch as solar PV and offshore or onshorewind have matured over the past years andenable an accelerated decarbonisation of thePower sector in NZE. Many industries rely onelectrification to achieve net zero by 2050 (forexample switching to zero-emissions vehiclesand EAFs), and this will not be possible withouta sufficient supply of low-carbon electricity.

Power demand is expected to increasesignificantly in the coming decade, drivenby both industry and residential sectors. It isestimated that around 800 million peopletoday21 still lack access to electricity, the majorityof whom live in emerging markets. Per capitaelectricity consumption will increase as theseeconomies develop and standards of living rise.

20Standard Chartered Net zero approach



It is essential that generators and distributorsleverage transition technologies and rapidlydecarbonise their operations to meet thisdemand in a sustainable way.

Many of our clients have already made netzero commitments, and we are engaging withthem to help reduce their emissions throughtechnologies such as renewables, CCUS andhydrogen. NZE assumes a more than threefoldincrease in global investment in electricitygeneration by 2030, including investment inexpansion and modernisation of electricitynetworks.



5.3.1. Baseline

We will seek to categorise clients according tofive subsectors, taking into account their primarybusiness activities:



• Power generators relying mainly on coaland/or oil as main energy sources



• Power generators relying on natural gas asmain energy source



• Power generators relying on renewablesand/or nuclear as main energy sources



• Power distributors (pure electricitydistributors)



• Other utilities providers (for examplewater suppliers and distributors, seweragecompanies, steam and air conditioningsupply companies)

For each power generation subsector,regressions have been run to derive theScope 1 and 2 revenue-based carbon intensities.For the power distributors, regressions were notrequired as actual Scope 1 and 2 emissions datawas available from a third-party provider for allclients in the baseline.



5.3.2. Projections

In NZE global electricity demand more thandoubles by 2050. Electricity accounts foralmost 50 per cent of total global energyconsumption, with 90 per cent being generatedfrom renewable sources (of which morethan 70 percent is produced by solar PV andwind). Emissions fall to zero by 2040 thenbecome negative, reflecting widespread use ofbioenergy with CCUS. Bioenergy is increasinglyused in the electricity sector, accounting foraround 5 per cent of final power generation mix.

Scope 1 is the material component of the sector’semissions. Scope 2 is minimal and relates toenergy used to operate power plants; its carbonintensity cannot be separated from the overallindustry electricity consumption. Scope 3 is notincluded as there is no agreed approach to itsquantification in this sector but, we note that itis less material than the Scope 1 emissions forthe sector.

Figure 7 shows the carbon intensity for the Powersector, separated between advanced economiesand emerging markets. Even in the 3.5°Cscenario, the intensity falls in emerging marketsas their reliance on coal reduces over time.

5.3.3. Target setting

For Power we are setting one target coveringthe four generation and distribution subsectors(i.e. excluding other utilities providers). In linewith SBTi guidance, the revenue-based carbonintensity target covers 100 per cent of in-scopefinancing for electricity generation.



Power target: 63 per cent reduction in revenue-based carbon intensity of our portfolio from2020 to 2030 (from 3.67 to 1.36kgCO2e/USD ofclient revenue).

Targets related to Power are supported by ourpublic power generation position statement,effective from March 2022.22

For the Power industry, the possible transitionpathway includes:

• Significantly lowering Scope 1 and 2 emissionsthrough the scale up of renewables, nuclear,CCUS, and hydrogen, with renewablespresenting a very large opportunity fortransition finance in the near term

• Selectively financing grid expansion andswitch to gas for clients, recognising thatthese are key enabling technologies thatsupport the transition towards greenersources of power. Switch to abated gaswill be key in the short-term to support thetransition away from thermal coal.

6\. Conclusion and next steps

23Standard Chartered Net zero approach



7\. Annex

7.1. Why did we choose theIEA for net zero analysis?

For the purposes of our analysis, we wanted tochoose a well-recognised scenario that reachesnet zero by 2050, is consistent with limitingglobal warming to 1.5⁰C above pre-industriallevels by the year 2100, and also complieswith the NZBA guidelines. As of today, thereare limited options to choose from in terms ofscenarios that offer the right level of granularityfor the purposes of our analysis.

The main alternative to NZE would be theNetwork for Greening the Financial System(NGFS) 1.5⁰C scenarios that were updated inJune 2021. We carefully considered NGFS as analternative to IEA, but opted to use IEA scenariosfor the following reasons:

• In NZE, all sectors of the economydecarbonise roughly to zero by 2050,whereas in NGFS there is more reliance onthe power sector (where net emissions aresignificantly negative by 2050) and less needfor other sectors to decarbonise. We judgethe NZE approach to be more appropriatedue to the onus it places on all parts of theeconomy.

• The carbon price increase assumed in theNGFS 1.5⁰C scenarios is significantly higherthan the corresponding increase in NZE.We judge the lower yet significant level ofreliance on high carbon prices in NZE to bemore appropriate.

• Both scenarios have fossil fuel productiondeclining significantly, to around one fifthof today’s production levels. We expectthis significant decline to lead to a fall infossil fuel prices. While we see this in theNZE scenario, the NGFS scenario has fossilfuel prices staying fairly constant, whichwe do not consider to be an appropriateassumption.

Only 20 per cent of the 1.5°C scenarios assessedby the IPCC have the same level of emissions

reduction ambition for the energy and industrialprocess sectors to 2050 as NZE. Furthermore,the IEA scenario has the lowest level of energy-related carbon dioxide removal and bioenergyof any IPCC assessed scenarios that achievesnet zero energy sector and industrial processCO2 emissions in 2050.

7.2. Approach to augmentationand projections aligned to a1.5⁰C outcome

While we have used the results from NZE aspublished by IEA in May 2021 as far as we can,in order to comply with external initiatives suchas SBTi and NZBA on target setting, we note afew limitations or gaps with respect to NZE asdetailed below:

• With a few exceptions, results are onlyat global granularity, meaning there areno regional or country level splits. Theexceptions include a split of CO2 emissionsinto two meta-regions: advanced andemerging markets23. It is especially importantfor our portfolio that the analysis is donewith regional granularity, to reflect differingstages of economic development withregions within emerging markets reachingnet zero after regions within advancedeconomies.

• The results are only for CO2, not otherGHG. The IEA comments that for the 1.5⁰Cwarming limit to be kept, there will need tobe commensurate reductions in other GHG,but they provide no quantification of these.

• Results for some individual sectors are notavailable in NZE: these include the coalproduction sector, the oil and gas productionsector, oil refining, liquefied natural gasterminals, and agriculture. Although NZEprovides projections for total CO2 emissionsand global usage of fossil fuels, these specificsectoral (Scope 1 and 2) results have notbeen published by the IEA.

• In general, results are only provided for 2019,2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050. The NZE doesinclude a few specific figures with data forintervening years (2025, 2035 and 2045),and where possible we have utilised thisadditional information.

To address these gaps and create a full set ofresults, we have enhanced NZE to create whatwe refer to as the Augmented NZE scenario:

• We have used the comprehensive andaudited BOP scenario to determine moregranular pathways. BOP is a scenarioaligned to the Paris Agreement, meaningit is a ‘well below 2⁰C’ scenario. It has 24sub-sectors and 12 regions as detailed inTable 2 and 3, respectively. Our approachhas been to pro-rate results for GHG acrossthese regions using BOP, preserving theglobal totals provided in NZE. We have alsopreserved results for ‘advanced economies’and ‘emerging markets economies’ that areseparately provided in Chapter 2 of the NZE24.

Table 2 – Sectoral emissions pathways expandedby Baringa Partners from the IEA scenarios

Table 3 – Regional expansion by Baringa Partnerswith 12 regions included

• Given NZE shows results for CO2 emissionsonly, for the other GHG, we have used theBOP projections. Other GHG fall by 75per cent between 2020 and 2050 in BOP,which is aligned to the IEA’s SustainableDevelopment Scenario (SDS)25. It is possiblethat a larger reduction may be needed tokeep within 1.5⁰C of warming, but withoutclearer guidance, any deviation from theSDS projections is arbitrary. Furthermore,changing the other GHG trajectory wouldnot impact on the CO2 trajectories that arebeing applied to our portfolio. In due course,as and when the NZE scenario is more fullydeveloped, the projections for other GHGcan be revisited. Note that all emissionsexcept CO2 are included within a singlesectoral bucket, given the absence of dataon each of the GHG separately, and thedominance of CO2 in the emissions total.

25Standard Chartered Net zero approach



• For sectors not specified in NZE, we haveretained the results from BOP. It may beargued that these specific sectors woulddecarbonise more in a net zero world thanthey do in BOP, which is a well below 2⁰Cscenario, but not necessarily as low as 1.5⁰C.However, we consider any quantificationof this to be arbitrary. Within the ‘Other’sector, we have included process emissions(e.g. conversion between different energyproducts such as in oil refineries), and otheremissions not specified in one of our keysectors. The ‘Other’ category is used toreconcile total global CO2 emissions andensure that all the results in the AugmentedNZE scenario are in agreement withpublished results in NZE.

• We have used NZE projections for totalCO2 emissions in advanced economies and

emerging markets26, to interpolate resultsfor 2025, 2035 and 2045 for each sector andregion. The IEA has published results for2019 and 2020 separately, the latter takingaccount of the impact of COVID-19. It isunclear how quickly the global economy willrecover from the pandemic. For this analysis,the assumption is that a full recovery willhave been achieved by 2025. Based on thisassumption, we have interpolated between2019 and 2030, not 2020 and 2030, to obtainresults for the year 2025 that are ‘normal’ inthe sense of not being affected by COVID-19\. A more refined treatment will be possiblewhen a more complete set of results ispublished by the IEA.

Our assumptions and their limitations aresummarised in Table 4.

Title Assumption Limitation



Regionalaugmentation

Regional results from BOP are scaled (preservingrelativities) to NZE meta-regions (advanced/developing)

In due course, the IEA may publish results forindividual regions



Sectoralaugmentation

BOP projections are further scaled to NZE resultsfor individual sectors (preserving NZE meta-regional results)

Judgement exercised (more than one wayof doing scaling)



Missing sectors For these sectors – Oil \& Gas production, oilrefining, LNG terminals, coal production,agriculture, Other GHG–BOP results are used(consistent with IEA SDS)

In due course, the IEA may publish resultsfor missing sectors. Other GHG are treatedtogether as a single sector



‘Other’ sector This category is used to reconcile total globalCO2 emissionsExact treatment of biomass, negative emissions,process emissions and other energy sectors isunclear



Interpolation NZE has results for 2019, 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050in Annex A. For CO2 only, at global level only, thereport provides additional results for 2025, 2035,2045\. We have augmented to a full set of resultsfor every five years

Judgement exercised (more than one way ofdoing temporal augmentation)



Covid impact Impact assumed to be short-term. Forinterpolation purposes, 2019 (not 2020) hasbeen used

Duration of COVID-19 impact is unknown



Limited price data Creating emission intensity pathways basedon production at counterparty level requiresproduct pricing information to derive productionvolumes (given known counterparty revenue)

There is limited pricing data in the NZE (fossilfuels, and power) but not for other sectors

7.3. Approach to projectionsaligned to a 3.5⁰C outcome:

The projections for a 3.5⁰C outcome have beenperformed using the 3.5°C scenario, which isclosely related to IEA’s CPS. All inputs can beretrieved and outputs explained in terms ofassumptions and model logic:

• The inputs from IEA CPS consist ofmacroeconomic growth, demand forproducts (such as fossil fuels, industrialoutput) and assumptions on other GHG. Byusing these inputs alongside the other datasources listed above, Baringa Partners hasdeveloped its 3.5°C scenario which yieldsoutcomes that are similar to those in the IEACPS. We have not attempted to match themexactly since the IEA CPS only goes to 2040,not 2050. Baringa Partners has extendedthe range of inputs and reach of its globalmodel so that the full timeframe to 2050 ismodelled.

• The CPS only considers measures at thegovernmental or regulatory level that havealready been implemented as of late 2019and hence, does not include the impact fromintended or announced policies. The CPSwas produced before the impact of COVID-19 was known, and hence projections forall years, including 2020, assume ‘normal’conditions in this scenario. This leads to aslight basis difference between NZE and CPS,but the effect is assumed to be short-termand to be minimal by 2025.

• Another key feature of the 3.5°C scenario isthat there is no international effort to reducecarbon emissions. In consequence, thereare no carbon pricing mechanisms (andno carbon prices) in this scenario. The keyassumptions for the 3.5°C scenario, and theirlimitations, are summarised in Table 5.

Title Assumption Limitation



Calibration to IEACPS 2019

Product demand levels – regionally and globally– are taken from IEA CPSDetailed information is restricted; all availableinformation has been utilised



Other GHG IEA CPS projections assumed; detailed modellingis limited to CO2Optimisation is restricted to CO2 and other GHGare considered as single sector



Range of policies Current policies as of 2019 considered by IEACPS; no further policies on decarbonisationintroduced

Policies introduced in 2020/21 or proposed arenot considered



COVID-19 impact Not modelled in 3.5⁰C-projections (from 2019base year) assume ‘normal’ conditions with noimpact from pandemic

Year 2020 is on different basis from NZE,which does model impact (especially large ontransport sector)



Commodity prices No carbon pricing; no effort to reduce GHGemissions beyond current (as of 2019) policiesProposals to introduce or intensify carbon pricingare not considered

7.4. Client-level transitionpathways

The following steps, as illustrated in Figure 8,outline our approach to create a rangeof trajectories for our clients, taking intoconsideration their decarbonisation plans.

Focusing on our three priority sectors, we haveassessed our clients’ transition risk mitigationplans, scoring their readiness to respond to riskby utilising information on public disclosuresand commitments. A ‘transition risk mitigationscore’ (TRM score) between 0 and 100 has beenderived for clients where we have the greatestexposures, which seeks to reflect their readinessto mitigate transition risk.

Figure 8 – Adjusted client trajectory

Utilse public climate commitments where available for the three priority sectors, inline with ‘Commitment trajectory’. In addition, where clients have not yet made publicclimate commitments but have declared intent to meet the requirements of theParis Agreement and have a high TRM score:

• Assume clients follow a 2°C trajectory (instead of a below 2°C trajectory tobe prudent)

• A high TRM score is considered to be greater or equal to the sample mean+ 1 standard deviation

For all other clients, assume clients follow the 3.5⁰C trajectory



Optimistictrajectory



Where clients in each of the three priority sectors have made public climatecommitments:

• Utilise public commitments fully to create a new trajectory for these clients• Where clients’ commitments are more ambitious then the NZE trajectory,use NZE to be prudent

Where clients in the three priority sectors have not made public climate commitments:• Assume clients follow the 3.5⁰C trajectory



Commitmenttrajectory



Where clients in each of the three priority sectors have made public climatecommitments and have a TRM score equal or greater to the sample mean

(based on detailed engagement with our top 2,000 clients):• Utilise public commitments fully to create client trajectory, using the NZEpathway if commitments are more ambitious than NZE

Where clients in the three priority sectors have not made public climate commitments:• Assume clients follow the 3.5⁰C trajectory
