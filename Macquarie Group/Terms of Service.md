Foreword fromMacquarie’s CEO

Macquarie’s response to climate changeis rooted in our organisational purpose —to empower people to innovate and investfor a better future.



1. No. 1 Global Renewables Infrastructure Financial Adviser, IJ Global (CY2021 by value).2. Supporting the transition to a net zero economy, macquarie.com.



Our response is based on three

overarching principles:



First, the science on our changing climate is clearand unequivocal. In its latest report, the UN’sIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change notedthat the world is already seeing widespread climate

disruption, affecting the lives of billions of people, and

that we can expect additional severe climate impacts.Human‑induced climate change, and the global responseto it, is an intergenerational issue that has for sometime shaped the focus and ongoing development ofour business.



Second, our greatest contribution will come throughpositive and practical climate solutions driven by ourcore capabilities. This includes developing and investingin green energy projects and related technologies atscale, advancing new climate solutions in transport, landuse, buildings, and industrial processes, and aligning theworld’s largest portfolio of infrastructure assets withglobal net zero emissions by 2040, while adapting to afast‑changing climate.



Third, we believe in a managed, orderly, and justtransition. This means supporting carbon‑intensiveindustries and companies including those in the oil/gas,electricity, agriculture, mining, transport, and wastesectors to decarbonise, while protecting the vitalservices and jobs that our communities rely on. Wehave a global approach, including an important focus onemerging markets where the transition is lagging, andmore rapid progress is needed if these markets are tomeet their sustainable growth ambitions within widerglobal climate goals.

As this Report shows, Macquarie is already supportinga range of practical climate solutions. We are the

top‑ranked global financial adviser for renewables,1 and

we have recently significantly increased our investment

in the green energy that the world needs and investorsare seeking to fund. At the end of September 2022, wewere involved in green energy projects totalling over

100 GW, with more than half of that total added to thedevelopment pipeline in the first half of Macquarie’scurrent financial year. Beyond energy, we have been

working with clients to support the decarbonisation of

the other major sources of emissions, including transport,agriculture and reducing the energy intensity of industrial

processes. Our fossil fuel financed emissions are already

relatively small compared to our global peers, and weexpect to see them reduce further as we implement our

pre‑existing commitment to run‑off our limited remaining

equity and lending exposures to the coal sector by2024.2 In addition, we are targeting emissions intensityreductions in the oil/gas and motor vehicle sectors. Wewill add to these sectors of focus in the years ahead.

Events of the past year have shown us that the world’spathway to net zero will not be straightforward. It isclearer than ever that accelerating the deploymentof climate solutions is the best collective response toour challenges — providing greater long‑term energysecurity at the lowest cost. While we must act withurgency, we will also need to be patient as the transition

will take time, and may require our financed emissions

to go up on occasion as we positively engage withhigh‑carbon industries to help them invest to deliver thechanges that they need to make.

Finally, while the actions of individual institutions areimportant, they are more powerful when pursued withpartners. The global transition to net zero will demand

strong partnerships between financial institutions

and our clients, between the private and publicsectors, and with communities, whose ongoingsupport for this unprecedented global transition iscritical. We are committed to maintaining andstrengthening these partnerships.

We hope that this Report gives you a clear sense of howwe think about our contribution to the world’s transitionto net zero, the role we play in driving practical andpositive climate solutions, and how we manageclimate risk.

We look forward to providing you with regular updateson our progress.

Summary ofMacquarie’sclimate strategy

Macquarie Group (Macquarie) has been driving practical

climate solutions for almost 20 years, with our first

investments in renewables dating back to 2005. Sincethen, we have evolved our approach year‑by‑year, buildingcapabilities to support the global transition to net zero.



In this section, we provide a summary of our climate strategy following the four

areas of action we identified last year as central to our approach.3

1 2 3 4Increase our investmentin climate mitigation andadaptation solutions.

Strengthen oursupport for clients andportfolio companiesto help achieve theirdecarbonisation ambitions.

Continue to reduce theemissions of our ownbusiness operations.

Align our financing activitywith the global goal of net zeroemissions by 2050.

3. Supporting the transition to a net zero economy, macquarie.com.4. This refers to on‑balance sheet lending and equity investment activities, excluding on‑balance sheet securities held for client facilitation and market‑making purposes (as opposedto held for investment). Lending refers to loan assets held at amortised cost and excludes certain items such as leasing, asset finance, trading assets and short‑term financing (e.g.,inventory finance). Note, for motor vehicles, we have also included novated leases, given availability of both methodology and data.



This is Macquarie’s first combined Group Net Zero and

Climate Risk Report (Report). The Report aims to alignwith emerging peer and industry practice, including the

criteria set out by the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA).

The Report covers climate‑related activities acrossMacquarie’s operating groups. However, in line with the

NZBA Guidelines, the sections dealing with financed

emissions are limited to our on‑balance sheet lendingand equity investment activities.4

We continue to support the important work of theTask Force on Climate‑related Financial Disclosures(TCFD) and are implementing its recommendationsbased on the four key pillars: governance; strategy;

risk management; and metrics and targets.



This Report sets out progress on our climate strategyimplementation and engagement, detailing how ourapproach has evolved, grown, and expanded in its scopeand reach. In 2021, we restated our commitment toclimate action with a broader net zero strategy. We have

since refined the commitment for our own businessoperations emissions to reach net zero in Scope 1 andScope 2 by 2025, while developing emissions reductionstrategies for Scope 3 and evolving our carbon neutrality

commitment in line with industry guidance (for furtherdetail, refer to Section 4 — Implementation andengagement). We also include details of our recentactivities including case studies and an outline of ourplanned next steps.

Since our net zero commitment last year, we have

focused our initial efforts on three carbon‑intensive

sectors (oil/gas, motor vehicles and coal) and inthis Report we have set science‑based targets for

those sectors.

For oil/gas, we have benchmarked against the Network

of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening theFinancial System (NGFS) Net Zero 2050 scenario.

NGFS is an international group of central banks and

supervisors, including the Reserve Bank of Australia and

the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).APRA’s recent Climate Vulnerability Assessment usedtwo NGFS scenarios with additional modelling for theAustralian context.



For motor vehicles (specifically passenger cars and light

commercial vehicles), we have benchmarked against theUnited Nations Principles for Responsible Investment(UN PRI) commissioned Inevitable Policy Response (IPR)1.5°C Required Policy Scenario (RPS), as that scenarioprovides granular data to analyse the Australian motorvehicle sector.



For coal, we have set our financed emissions targetbased on our pre‑existing commitment to run‑off our

limited remaining on‑balance sheet lending and equityexposure to coal companies by 2024.11

Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 7

Our financed emissions targets



Oil/gas

Our equity and lending exposures to the oil/gas sectorcomprise less than 1 per cent of our total equity andlending exposures and are small compared to most ofour global and Australian peers. We target reducingScopes 1, 2 and 3 physical emissions intensity by

10–15 per cent from FY2020 levels by 2030.



Motor vehicles

We target reducing Scope 1 and 2physical emissions intensity by

34 per cent from FY2020 levels

by 2030.



Coal

In line with our pre‑existing commitmentto run‑off our limited remaining on‑balancesheet lending and equity exposure to coalcompanies, we target reducing Scopes 1, 2and 3 absolute financed emissions to zero bythe end of 2024.12,13



12. This target does not include any emissions associated with potential projects that will significantly reduce GHG emissions in line with science‑based scenarios or are for the purposeof diversifying away from the coal sector in line with a credible transition plan.13. The power generation sector includes exposure to both renewable and conventional power generation, as well as small exposure to coal‑fired power generation, which is covered byour pre‑existing coal run‑off commitment (refer to Section 5 — Metrics and targets).



For coal, in addition to setting a target, we have

also analysed historical financed emissions for the

coal mining segment of the sector — in FY2020, this

accounted for more than half of our financed emissions

from fossil fuel sectors.

While the fossil fuel and motor vehicle sectorscomprise a small portion of our total lending and equityinvestments, they are likely to have represented the

majority of our total financed emissions in the FY2020base year. In 2023, data allowing, we aim to include the

residential mortgage and power generation sectors.13



These sectors, taken together with those included this

year, will account for a significant majority of our totalfinancing activities. In line with the NZBA Guidelines, we

expect to set targets for all material carbon‑intensivesectors by the end of 2024.



We have also set out our approach to climate riskmanagement and governance, including our climatescenario analysis work and the continued integrationand operationalisation of climate risk across Macquarie’srisk management frameworks, policies, and procedures.

We will report on our progress on these topics annually.

In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) concluded14 that human influence on the warming

of the atmosphere, ocean and land is unequivocal, and thatthe world needs to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionsto net zero by 2050 if we are to limit the increase in globaltemperatures in 2100 to 1.5°C and thereby meaningfullyreduce the risk of catastrophic impacts.

Encouragingly, most governments accept the needfor urgent action, with over 125 countries formallycommitted to achieving net zero by 2050, and a further12, including China, India and Russia, committed toreaching net zero between 2050 and 2070.15

These countries represent more than 80 per cent ofglobal emissions and over 90 per cent of global Gross

Domestic Product (GDP), reflecting much‑improved

coverage in recent years.

Many of the world’s biggest companies, including in the

highest‑emitting sectors and large financial institutions,

are also working towards net zero. However, while someprogress has been made, there is much more work to bedone, with current policies and announced pledges stillfalling short of the required ambition.

With fossil fuels still accounting for around 80 per centof global primary energy consumption, the path tonet zero will require the largest reorganisation of theglobal economy and energy systems since the industrialrevolution. However, at Macquarie, we remain optimisticthat the world will rise to this challenge, as increasedinvestment combines with human ingenuity to drive thenecessary technological change. Indeed, most advancedeconomies, led by Europe, have already made progresstowards reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

There are multiple pathways to net zero, with theultimate outcome likely to depend in large part on thescale of clean energy investment as well as where andwhen technological innovation occurs. The focus needs

to be on rapidly expanding electrification and clean

energy capacity, storage, and distribution. As we haveseen in the progress made by advanced economies inrecent years, expansion in clean energy capacity needsto grow faster than underlying energy consumption tomeaningfully reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

High fossil fuel prices are encouraging increased

investment in alternative energy sources and efficiency,

with the International Energy Agency (IEA) expectingclean energy investment18 to have increased by morethan 10 per cent in 2022 to a new high of around$US1.4 trillion.19 However, in the short term, energyinsecurity has also forced governments to temporarilyincrease their reliance on fossil fuels, despite ongoingdecarbonisation ambitions.

Unsurprisingly, estimates of the quantum of cleanenergy investment required to allow the world toquickly move away from high‑emitting fossil fuels vary

significantly, but there is little doubt that clean energy

capital expenditure will need to increase dramatically.For example, the IEA estimates that clean energyinvestment would need to triple to over $US4 trillion

per annum by 2030 to put the world on a path towards

reaching net zero by 2050.20

18. “Clean energy investment” in this section is as defined by the IEA. For more information, see page 488 of IEA (2022), World Energy Outlook 2022, IEA, Paris.19. IEA (2022), World Energy Investment 2022, IEA, Paris.20. IEA (2022), World Energy Outlook 2022, IEA, Paris.21. Based on extrapolated GDP forecasts from IMF (2022), World Economic Outlook, October.



While that would be a significant step up, such a level

of spending would not be without historical precedent.For example, the US government spent 6.5–7 per centof GDP on public investment for much of the 1950s and1960s, while total global investment is currently around$US26 trillion per year (27 per cent of GDP). A total

spend of $US4 trillion in 2030 would be equivalent toaround 3 per cent of global GDP.21

Some of the required expenditure will occur through arebalancing of business‑as‑usual investment, while thelong‑term decline in the cost of renewable technologiesshould provide an economic incentive. However,an increase of this scale will take some time, as theworld works to overcome production and deploymentbottlenecks, including shortages of skilled labour andconstruction of infrastructure.

Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 12

To significantly cut global GHG emissions, the world

must burn less coal. However, with coal still accountingfor more than one quarter of global primary energysupply, science‑based net zero by 2050 scenarios

recognise the need for oil and gas to remain a significant

part of the energy mix well into the future.

For example, IEA modelling22

 suggests that under currentpolicies, oil and gas investment would need to increase

between now and 2030. Only once annual investment in

clean energy moves towards $US2.5 trillion (an increaseof around 90 per cent from the 2021 level) will theworld be able to gradually reduce aggregate oil and gasinvestment without energy shortages.

The seismic changes required to the structure of theglobal economy are unlikely to occur unless governmentstake the lead, providing both economic and regulatoryincentives. However, with government debt levels highin many countries, the private sector will need to play

a critical role in financing the transition. Reflecting

this reality, under its net zero by 2050 scenario, theIEA assumes that around 70 per cent of the required

financing by 2030 comes from the private sector.

Implementationand engagement

How we are implementing our climate strategy andengaging with stakeholders across a diverse range ofbusinesses and activities.



In this section, we demonstrate how we have built our climate solutions capabilities

and how our strategy has evolved, specifically addressing the four areas of action weidentified last year as central to our approach.24

Increase our investmentin climate mitigation andadaptation solutions.

Strengthen oursupport for clients andportfolio companiesto help achieve theirdecarbonisation ambitions.

Continue to reduce theemissions of our ownbusiness operations.

Align our financing activitywith the global goal of net zeroemissions by 2050.



For each of these areas, we detail recent activities, near‑term planned actions and case studies to demonstrate the

impact of our activity. By focusing on concrete examples, we demonstrate the depth and breadth of our climate

contribution, with climate‑related projects and considerations increasingly becoming business‑as‑usual in each of ouroperating and support areas and across regions.

Action area 1:



Increasing our investment in climate mitigation and adaptation solutions



Building on our history of developing and managing essential infrastructure, we have long recognised that maximising

our investment in green energy technology is the most meaningful climate action we can take. Our ambition is tomaintain and grow our role as a leading supporter of green energy and other climate solutions around the globe.

We are actively investing in the development of new green energy and have more than doubled our green energy

capacity pipeline in the first half of our financial year.

Having played a key role in establishing green energy technologies such as utility‑scalewind and solar as an investible asset class, we continue to innovate in emerging areas ofopportunity such as hydrogen, carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and energystorage. We are also investing in feed supplements for livestock, electric vehicles (EVs), andvoluntary carbon markets.

The aim is to create and scale the solutions that will allow for a balanced green energysystem, and the decarbonisation of transport, buildings, agriculture, and industrial processes.

To support our ambition to increase investment in climate solutions, in early 2022, wemoved our Green Investment Group (GIG) into Macquarie Asset Management (MAM). This

move allows us to combine the market leading project development and finance expertiseof GIG and its portfolio specialist development platforms, with the fiduciary capital

resources entrusted to MAM.

A. Enabling assets and people to adapt to a changing world



As the world’s largest infrastructure manager and a leading developer of new greenfield infrastructure, we are

working to improve the resilience of our real asset portfolio companies to the impacts of climate change and toensure continuity of essential community services. Such initiatives include burying power lines to protect against

extreme temperatures and fires, relocating infrastructure to protect from rising sea levels and stronger winds, and

improving food security through higher yield precision farming techniques. We also play an active role in helpingclients manage energy price volatility, with the goal of maintaining energy supply to households and economies.



Recent case studies



Adapting criticalinfrastructure toextreme climate events



In the Philippines we supported our portfoliocompany, Energy Development Corporation, toincrease the resilience of its 1.5 GW renewableenergy portfolio against future extremeweather events to ensure continuity of supplyto communities. This important capitalinvestment included rerouting pipelines andre‑engineering cooling towers to withstandtyphoons with greater than 300 kph winds.

In Australia, we are supporting portfoliocompany Endeavour Energy in utilisinggeospatial analysis from light detection andranging data, to assess and quantify the riskof bushfires from vegetation near its network.This enables a more targeted and efficientvegetation maintenance program and, asa result, more proactive management ofbushfire risks and potential damage to powersupply infrastructure.



Helping clientsmanage theircommodity risk



The Commodity Markets and Financebusiness within CGM provides a full serviceoffering of risk management, capital andfinancing, market access and physicalexecution and logistics to clients withexposure to commodity markets. As partof this, the business offers products toclients to reduce risk from the impactsof the increased volatility that can resultfrom climate events, as well as geopoliticaltensions. In doing so, we play an importantrole in ensuring the continuity of energysupply to businesses and communities.

An example of this is the role we play insupporting our European utilities clients whoare importing gas from the US given recentsupply constraints in the region which havebeen exacerbated by weather events. Ourhedging products enable them to managethe price risk associated with moving gasfrom one location to another, which iscritical to maintain stability of energy supplyas the world transitions energy sources.



Helping peoplereskill to workon the transition



Following catalytic funding from theMacquarie Group Foundation, the youthemployment non‑profit Generation UKhas created a new training programfor unemployed young people thatwill enable them to find jobs in thegreen sector.

The training is being delivered by expertinstructors and includes one‑on‑onementorship for learners, and placementwith employer partners uponcompletion.

B. Accelerating the move to clean mobility



A key component of most science‑based net zero by 2050 scenarios is the greening of the transport fleet, with

recent policy announcements in many regions showing a determination to quickly adopt electric vehicles (EVs). InAustralia, our retail banking business is helping clients switch to EVs. More broadly, Macquarie is helping commercial

fleet operators finance the deployment of clean vehicles and their charging infrastructure in the US, the Netherlands,Belgium, Germany, and the UK.



Recent case studies



Helping ourbanking clientsswitch to EVs inAustralia



EVs have steadily increased as a percentageof new vehicles financed throughMacquarie’s direct channel. We expect thisnumber to grow in line with broader supplyand policy developments.

Our Banking and Financial Services(BFS) business, which is also committedto helping our clients navigate thefast‑changing industry landscape on EVownership, has undertaken an advocacycampaign to educate and informconsumers on the benefits of transitioningto an EV, and maintains a specialised EVbuying service.



Rolling outEV charginginfrastructurein Europe



GIG launched Fleete in September 2022, anew company that aims to remove barriersto commercial EV adoption, by offeringto install, manage, and finance charginginfrastructure for a monthly fee and withno up‑front costs. Fleete provides ultrafastcharging equipment and software forscheduling of charging sessions with an eyeon optimising energy consumption.

GIG has also announced a partnership withHeliox to deliver fully funded EV charginginfrastructure to public transport andcommercial fleet operators in Europe.



Partnering todeploy hydrogentrucks in the US



CGM is part of a consortium that was awardedgrant funding by the California Air ResourcesBoard and the California Energy Commission’sClean Transportation Program to deliver 30hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks and associatedrefuelling infrastructure in California.

The project combines efforts of industryleaders to advance the transition oftransportation to zero emissions in California.Macquarie’s ownership and leasing of thetrucks to international logistics company GlovisAmerica marks an important milestone for thebusiness as they look to progress similar vehiclerollouts across the commercial transportationsector in the future.

Our expertise in action



How we are using our deep capabilities in energy, infrastructure, technology and commodities to create practicalclimate solutions.



Creating specialist businesses acrossclimate solutions



MAM has created a series of specialist businesses and project developers that each aim to be marketleaders in their focus areas.Corio Generation, launched in 2022, has one of the world’s largest offshore wind developmentportfolios.On‑land developers (Cero Generation, Island Green Power and Apex Energies in Europe; Blueleaf Energyand CleanMax in Asia; and Reden Solar in Europe and the Americas) are building clean energy projectsand helping their customers procure clean electricity for their operations.In September 2022, GIG launched Fleete, an EV charging‑as‑a‑service company that installs, manages,and finances EV charging infrastructure with no up‑front costs. Additionally, in November 2022, GIGlaunched Eku Energy — a new global battery storage platform.



Unlocking progress with innovative solutions



Macquarie Capital (MacCap) has a long track record in making principal investments to help financeclimate solutions. In 2018, MacCap invested in Form Energy, Inc., an energy company that aimsto address remaining impediments to unlocking the power of renewable energy to transform theelectricity grid. Form Energy is developing and commercialising ultra‑low‑cost, long‑duration energystorage systems that can be located in any market and scaled to match existing energy generationinfrastructure globally. These systems have the potential to significantly improve the reliability andtransmission of renewables year‑round, extending transmission capacity without building new wires,and completely replacing the need for conventional thermal generation.MacCap also created renewable fuels platform Aerogy, which develops, operates, and invests ininnovative renewable natural gas (RNG) projects across the US. Methane is among the most significantcontributors to global warming, with emissions from livestock in the agriculture sector comprisingapproximately 32 per cent of human‑caused methane emissions. RNG aims to address this bydiverting methane released from cow manure and other sources and converting it into low‑carbonenergy. Upon its launch, Aerogy closed financing and commenced construction at Zahn’s Farm,a leading dairy producer located near Gillett, Wisconsin.



Investing in a pioneering carbon capture business



Macquarie’s Commodities and Global Markets (CGM) group’s investment in Storegga Limited(Storegga) has created an independent, international developer of carbon capture and storage (CCS),hydrogen and direct air capture projects to accelerate carbon emissions reductions.Storegga is the lead developer of the Acorn CCS and Hydrogen project in Aberdeen, and is alsodeveloping both green and blue hydrogen projects and a utility‑scale direct air capture plant in theUK. Macquarie’s investment will support these ongoing projects and Storegga’s business developmentactivities as they expand and continue to build a global portfolio of low‑carbon projects.

Partnering with clients to work together on theirdecarbonisation journeys is becoming business‑as‑usualacross our operating groups. Each Macquarie operatinggroup is engaging in a range of activities aligned to ourclimate strategy and net zero commitments.

Across our Macquarie Asset Management (MAM)Private Markets portfolio, asset management teams areworking closely with over 165 private market portfoliocompanies and assets where we exercise control or

significant influence to implement net zero plans in

line with MAM’s 2040 commitment — to report andverify emissions, set reduction targets, and developbusiness plans to achieve these targets.28 For newlyacquired assets, we are seeking to complete these stepswithin 24 months of acquisition. Our Green InvestmentGroup (GIG) team is working to drive the large‑scaledeployment of the mature technologies of wind andsolar as well as delivering pioneering approaches toaccelerate deployment of emerging technologies likehydrogen, biogas, and e‑mobility. Where our asset

management teams do not have significant influence

(for example, in our Public Investment portfolios), weare pursuing our net zero goals in alignment with our

client‑guided fiduciary and regulatory responsibilities.

The Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)analytical tools used by MAM’s Public Investments teamsprovide insight into the carbon footprints of individualinvestments and portfolios and enable targeted

engagement and proxy voting efforts.



Our Commodities and Global Markets (CGM) businessis supporting clients in their decarbonisation pathways,utilising our deep expertise and capabilities across theenergy spectrum and our leading commodities and

financial markets platform. We provide capital andfinancing solutions, risk management, physical execution

and logistics services, as well as market access to clientsacross voluntary and compliance carbon markets,

renewables and flexible power, clean fuels, sustainable

Supporting MAM’s portfolio companies



In line with MAM’s commitment to invest and manage our portfolio in line with global net zero by2040, we are working closely with our Private Markets portfolio companies in their transition. Ourroadmap to achieving our goal is set out in the MAM 2021 Sustainability Report. As part of this weare on a journey of learning, adapting, and working collaboratively to address a range of challenges,including:

Stakeholders: obtaining key stakeholder agreement, including from portfolio company managementteams, co‑shareholders, and clients.

Technology: addressing availability and commercial viability of appropriate technology, such ascarbon capture.

Financing: developing appropriate financing to support the sometimes capital intensive requirementsof decarbonisation.

Regulation: navigating different regulatory regimes, including gaining support from regulators andovercoming regulatory disincentives or caps.

Forecasting: overcoming limitations associated with the long‑term cost of abatement initiatives inportfolio company business planning.



Finding solutions in hard‑to‑abate sectors



The Global Carbon business, which launched in 2021, builds on CGM’s 15‑year involvement in physicaland financial environmental product markets globally. CGM provides clients with integrated carbonoffsetting solutions, representing an important bridge into longer‑term structural decarbonisation.As part of this, CGM is directly involved and invests in offset generating projects that can be broughtto market. For example, we partnered with and invested alongside carbon project developerC‑Quest Capital LLC to develop a Sub‑Saharan Africa clean cookstove program. This program isexpected to supply more than 200 million carbon credits, with verified contributions towards multipleUN Sustainable Development Goals, to the voluntary carbon market over the next 10 years.

Continuing to reduce the emissions of our own business operations



31. For example, as appropriate and relevant: Net Zero Banking Alliance Offsets Position Paper and Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting.



The environmental impact of Macquarie’s own businessoperations predominantly relates to the resources we

consume in our offices, data centres, business travel,

and our procurement activities. We seek to managethis impact by monitoring and reducing resource use,maintaining innovative and sustainable workplaces,maintaining carbon neutrality, and improving thesustainability of our supply chain.

Macquarie’s 2025 Sustainability Plan articulates our

corporate sustainability commitments with specific and

measurable targets across environmental and socialpillars. In line with this plan, we have continued to make

significant progress in reducing the emissions of our

own business operations. For further details refer to

Section 5 — Metrics and targets.



Moving from carbon neutrality towards net zeroemissions for our own business operations



Macquarie has been carbon neutral since 2010, and weare committed to maintaining our carbon neutrality

status for Scope 1 and 2 emissions and Scope 3 business

travel emissions through to 2025 in line with our 2025Sustainability Plan.

We recognise that achieving carbon neutrality is

different from achieving net zero. Our first priority will

be to develop approaches to reduce emissions whereverpossible in our own business operations. We have

undertaken detailed assessments of our Scope 1, 2 and3 emissions and will work on specific strategies across

the three scopes of emissions for our net zero targets.Going forward we will report on our commitment to netzero emissions of our own business operations covering

Scope 1 and 2 emissions, separate to upstream Scope 3operational value chain emissions. We will work towardsdeveloping a longer‑term Scope 3 operational value

chain emissions reduction target aligned to science.Further detail on our metrics and progress is provided

Section 5 — Metrics and targets.

In line with emerging industry guidance, banks can use

offsets for the attainment of interim and end‑state

operational net zero targets. Where residual orhard‑to‑abate emissions exist, we may seek to utilise

credible offsets to achieve targets. 31

32. The equivalent of 100 per cent of our FY2022 electricity consumption was sourced from renewable sources through a combination of green tariffs (43 per cent) and energyattribute certificates (57 per cent). Due to a lack of availability, we were unable to source renewable energy certificates within the South Korean market, which is a requirement ofthe RE100 market boundary criteria. All other renewable energy purchases were sourced in line with the criteria, and we were 98.4 per cent compliant at FY2022.33. From FY2010 to FY2020, the calculation of business travel emissions was limited to air travel. In FY2021, the calculation was expanded to include both air and rail travel. In FY2022,the calculation of business travel emissions was expanded further to include hotels, ground transportation and food \& beverages. In FY2022, the calculation of air travel emissionswas also refined to reflect the class of ticket flown (e.g., economy, business class).



How we are using our deep capabilities in energy, infrastructure, technology and commodities to create practicalclimate solutions.



Using renewable energy



In 2019, Macquarie joined RE100, a global corporate renewable energy initiative which bringstogether businesses that source the equivalent of 100 per cent renewable electricity for theiroperations. Our commitment was to source the equivalent of 100 per cent renewable electricityacross our global offices and data centres by FY2025. In FY2022, Macquarie sourced the equivalentof 100 per cent of our electricity consumption from renewable sources through a combination ofgreen tariffs and energy attribute certificates. 98.4 per cent32 of our renewable energy purchaseswere sourced in line with the RE100 market boundary criteria.



Reducing electricity use



In FY2022, Macquarie achieved a 36 per cent reduction in electricity use (from a FY2014 baseline),well exceeding the original target of a 20 per cent reduction. We will re‑baseline in 2024 upon thecompletion of the construction of our new global headquarters in Sydney.



Mitigating our residual emissions



Since 2010, Macquarie has maintained carbon neutrality by offsetting residual Scope 1 and 2emissions and Scope 3 business travel emissions.33



Macquarie will continue to purchase voluntary carbon credits certified by credible external bodiesfor quality, permanence, and verifiable emissions reductions and will evolve our offset strategy inline with industry guidance.

Overview of our financed emissions commitment



39. The NZBA Guidelines apply to banks’ lending and investment activities (GHG Protocol Scope 3, Category 15). Refer to page 6 for further details of product inclusion and exclusion.



For financial institutions, the bulk of emissions typicallycome from financed emissions (Scope 3, Category 15).

For Macquarie, this relates to our lending and equityinvestments made in carbon‑intensive sectors.



Under the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) Guidelines,

net zero commitments are expected to include the

“significant majority” of emissions associated withfinancing activities39 within 36 months. This initially

needs to focus on the following carbon‑intensive sectors

(on a “comply or explain” basis): Agriculture, Aluminium,

Cement, Coal, Commercial and Residential RealEstate, Iron and Steel, Oil and Gas, Power Generation,

and Transport.

In this Report, we disclose our financed emissions andinterim targets for upstream oil/gas and motor vehicles.

We also disclose our baseline financed emissions for

coal mining, which is the most material segment of the

coal value chain by exposure, and set a 2024 financed

emissions target for the coal sector, based on ourpre‑existing commitment. Refer to Section 5 on Coal forfurther details of our pre‑existing coal commitment and

our financed emissions for the coal mining segment of

the sector.

While these sectors comprise a small portion of our totallending and equity investments, they are likely to have

represented the majority of our total financed emissions

in the FY2020 base year.

Next year, data allowing, we are planning to includeresidential mortgages and the power generation sector.This will increase coverage to approximately 75 per cent

of our total financing activities. In line with the NZBA

Guidelines, by the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect tocover all material carbon‑intensive sectors in our lendingand equity investments exposure.

Approach to calculating financed emissions baseline and target setting



46. Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial industry.



Our framework for analysing Macquarie’s financed emissions (Scope 3, Category 15) reflects industryrecommendations, including guidance from the GHG Protocol, Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ),NZBA, United Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Task Force on Climate‑related

Financial Disclosures (TCFD). It also leverages the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Standard,46our internal expertise, and the most relevant, impactful, and credible data and metrics to drive progress.



A key feature of our framework is the use of sector‑specific methodologies, which underpins our approach to setting

targets. The following diagram outlines the framework we applied:

1\. Define sector and product scope



To ensure appropriate focus across our financing

activities, we began our analysis by covering the most

carbon‑intensive sectors that we finance, where we can

have the greatest potential impact in supporting ourclients’ decarbonisation journeys. These sectors alsohave appropriate methodologies and data that enabledus to set science‑based sectoral targets.



In line with the NZBA Guidelines, to define a sector, weused a combination of ANZSIC and GICS codes, business

and product taxonomy in our systems, as well as ourbroader knowledge of our clients and their activities.In addition, for coal, in line with evolving industrypractice, we also used the share of companies’ revenuethat comes from coal‑related activities. The breadthof the business activities covered by our net zero plan

for financed emissions includes the on‑balance sheetlending and equity investment activities (as per page 6

of this Report) of both the banking and non‑bankingbusinesses of Macquarie. Where data and methodologyallow, we also include other products, e.g., in motorvehicles product scope we have included novated leases.



2\. Select metrics



Once the sector and product scope were defined,

we developed one or more metrics for measuringand tracking emissions performance of companiesand clients within those sectors in our portfolio.Considerations included available guidance andmethodologies, commonly used metrics and datasources, as well as decarbonisation strategies implied bynet zero pathways and our business strategy.

In line with the UNEP FI Guidelines for Climate Target

Setting for Banks,47 we have calculated and reported

both absolute financed emissions and physical emissions

intensity metrics for each in‑scope sector.48 ThoseGuidelines allow us to choose one or both metrics insetting sector targets. For sectors that will continue toplay a key role in the economy into 2050, such as motorvehicles and oil/gas, we have chosen to set targets interms of physical emissions intensities.

Our approach also recognises that, while the overallobjective is to decrease global emissions on an absolutebasis to net zero by 2050, rapid reallocation of capitalfrom carbon‑intensive assets could lead to undesirableconsequences. We plan to achieve our net zero targets inline with broader ESG considerations, and to continue to

support activities that advance carbon‑efficient delivery

of resources and support the rights of developingcountries for economic development and accessto energy.



47. UNEP FI Guidelines for Climate Change Target Setting.48. NZBA also requires reporting of portfolio‑wide economic intensity e.g., CO2e/$ lent or invested. However, this metric will be more meaningful once we have covered the remainingcarbon‑intensive sectors and larger proportion of our financing activities.49. Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, Guidance on use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions.



In line with the PCAF Standard and the NZBA Guidelines,our approach covers our clients’ Scope 1, Scope 2 andScope 3 emissions, where significant and where data

allows. We expect the quality and availability of ourclients’ emissions data to improve over time, and our

view of the significance of emissions scopes may evolve

as this data improves.



3\. Establish the baseline



Prior to assessing net zero pathways and targets, we

established our financed emissions baselines for each

in‑scope sector. Having a measure of our baseline

financed emissions enables us to measure the carbon

performance of in‑scope sectors of our portfolio overtime. At this stage within our framework, we madeseveral methodological determinations, outlined indetail below.



Our baseline reporting year is from 1 April 2019 to31 March 2020 (Macquarie’s FY2020). We chose that

baseline as it avoids potential distortions caused byCOVID‑19 in FY2021, and to a lesser extent in FY2022.



4\. Determine net zero pathway



After choosing metrics and establishing the baseline,we analysed how to align our in‑scope sectors toscience‑based net zero pathways. That involved selecting

a sector‑specific scenario for which decarbonisation

pathways are available or can be reasonably derived. Inselecting our benchmark scenarios, we complied with

the criteria set out in the latest GFANZ Guidance,49ensuring appropriateness to the nature of our business,including sectoral and geographical relevance.

In some cases, it was necessary to perform additionalanalysis to account for emissions included in our metrics.For example, for the oil/gas sector, when assessing theavailable net zero scenarios it was necessary to derivethe relevant physical emissions intensity metric basedon the scenario projected energy sector emissions andprojected energy demand estimates.

Assessing performance of our sector portfolios againstindustry scenarios does not mean that we necessarilyadopt all the assumptions as part of our net zero action

plan. We are supportive of efforts to facilitate globaland country‑specific, cross‑industry collaboration to

enhance comparability of decarbonisation targets withour peers. We also closely monitor development ofdecarbonisation pathways and will revisit our approachas those scenarios evolve.

Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 37

5\. Estimate interim target



Based on our selected net zero pathway, we estimatedwhere our sector portfolio needs to be by 2030.

Depending on the granularity of available scenarioprojections, and available science‑based target setting

methodologies, targets may be set as a specific value oras a percentage reduction from a specified baseline.



The actual performance of our portfolio againstthese targets may not follow a linear pathway, withyear‑to‑year volatility to be expected as the portfoliochanges over time. We will continue to work with our

clients across these sectors in different regions to

support their transitions.



50. Our coal target is based on our pre‑existing commitment to run‑off our limited remaining on‑balance sheet lending and equity exposure to coal companies (inclusive of both coalmining and coal‑fired power generation, and covering both metallurgical and thermal coal) by the end of 2024.



6\. Reassess as inputs change or evolve



Industry net zero scenarios are expected to be updated

periodically to reflect relevant changes in the energy

market, emission trends, data availability, governmentpolicy, and availability of transition technologies. Theseupdates may lead to changes in net zero pathways,which may require updates to our targets. In addition,new or additional data may become available, which

may enable us to refine and improve the quality of

our metrics.

Therefore, as a critical element of our framework, wewill periodically reassess key inputs and assumptions andadjust our targets and baselines as needed.

51. These are the REMIND‑MAgPIE model, the MESSAGEix‑GLOBIOM model, and the GCAM model. Our analysis is based on the recent NGFS Phase III scenarios, published inSeptember 2022, with the oil/gas target derived from the model with the most significant estimated reduction in physical emissions intensity. For more information, seeClimate Scenarios for Central Banks and Supervisors.



Oil/gas



In determining net zero pathways for our initial in‑scopesectors, we conducted an extensive review of availablescience‑based net zero by 2050 scenarios, including

the International Energy Agency (IEA) NZE, Networkof Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening theFinancial System (NGFS) Net Zero 2050, and other

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)aligned scenarios. For the oil/gas sector, we adopted the

NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario in setting our initial 2030

target for several reasons:• The NGFS scenarios acknowledge the uncertaintyinherent in climate scenario modelling, making useof three alternative models51 for each of the sixscenarios they consider, including the orderly Net

Zero 2050 scenario. The NGFS scenarios are broadly

consistent with a range of IPCC scenarios.• These scenarios are designed to provide a common

starting point for the financial sector to analyseclimate risks to the economy and financial

system. Moreover, two NGFS scenarios, based onthe Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), wereused by APRA with additional modelling for theAustralian context in its recent Climate VulnerabilityAssessment (see Section 7 — Risk management forfurther information).• The NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario generally entails a

relatively rapid phase‑out of coal, while acknowledgingthat oil/gas are likely to remain an important partof the energy mix over the rest of this decade, asrenewables capacity is built out. This aligns withMacquarie’s views on the most feasible net zeropathway for oil/gas.• The NGFS scenarios provide a high level of regionaland sectoral granularity. In addition, these scenariosare expected to be updated frequently with improvedusability and transparency.



Motor vehicles



Following an extensive review of available net zeroscenarios, we benchmarked our alignment using thedecarbonisation pathway for motor vehicles underthe UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)commissioned Inevitable Policy Response (IPR) 1.5°CRequired Policy Scenario (RPS).

In selecting a pathway for motor vehicles, we focusedon several guiding principles, which included identifying

a pathway that met the NZBA Guidelines, as well asproviding region‑specific analysis to ensure a plausible

pathway covering nuances within the Australian market.



Future updates



We intend to review the NGFS, UN PRI commissionedIPR RPS, and other industry net zero scenarios each yearand consider recalibration of our benchmark targets.

Sector overview



In science‑based, net zero‑aligned climate scenarios

(e.g., NGFS Net Zero 2050, IEA NZE and IPCC), oil and gas

generally remain critical components of the energy mix

in 2030, which means decarbonisation of the operations

of oil/gas companies is an important element of theenergy transition, especially in the near term. In addition,

those scenarios assume this sector plays a significant

role in developing new technologies, such as CCUS, anddevelopment of alternative, low and zero carbon sourcesof energy.

Divestment strategies might not support real worldemissions reductions and could result in a disorderly netzero transition that does not address the economic and

social needs of the communities affected. Therefore, our

approach for this sector is based on partnering with our

clients to support their decarbonisation efforts.



Activities in scope



Our methodology for this sector currently focuses on

Scope 1 and 2 emissions of upstream oil/gas, as well asScope 3, combustion‑related emissions by end users.While the industry recognises that end‑use Scope 3

emissions are not directly controlled by upstream oil/gascompanies, we have included them in our analysis,as they contribute the majority of emissions withinthis sector. For many clients, as they lack control and

influence in reducing combustion‑related emissions, thereduction in Scope 3 emissions intensity will need tobe enabled by significant developments in government

policy, technology, and end‑use consumption.



In line with the NZBA Guidelines, the product

scope includes lending and equity investments.52The industry guidance and methodology for theseproducts is still evolving. We will continue to monitorindustry developments.



Measuring emissions



In line with the PCAF Guidance, our methodology initiallyplaces higher importance on emissions reported by ourclients, sourced either via public databases (e.g., CarbonDisclosure Project (CDP)) or reported directly to us. Toassess reasonableness of this client reported data, wehave compared it against industry benchmarks.



However, the industry faces significant data availability

and quality challenges when measuring emissions. Lessthan 50 per cent of our clients in March 2020 were ableto provide emissions estimates.

Where our clients did not report their emissions,we initially estimated their emissions using clientreported production data and weighted emissionsintensity factors from the IEA.53 For the remainingexposure, where production data for our clients wasnot available, emissions were proxied using the averageintensity of the portfolio for which emissions have beencalculated. Refer to Appendix 2 for further details onemissions calculations.



2030 interim target



Our methodology for target setting supports the need

for a rapid decline in emissions from flaring, fugitive,

and vented methane emissions. We also recognisethat companies in the oil/gas sector need to invest innew technologies, such as CCUS, and transition theirbusinesses from the production of high‑carbon fuelsto low and zero carbon sources of energy, therebycontributing to a reduction in emissions. Given oursmall lending and equity exposure to this sector, and

our limited ability to influence the degree of global

combustion, our approach is based on continuingto support clients in this sector in reducing theiroperational and end‑use carbon emissions. Therefore, weset targets for our portfolio based on physical emissions

intensity for Scopes 1, 2 and 3.



Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 40

Using the emissions pathway implied by the NGFS Net

Zero 2050 scenario, we have set a physical emissions

intensity reduction target of 10–15 per cent relative tothe FY2020 baseline. Given the underlying uncertaintysurrounding both portfolio emissions estimates and thescenario‑implied transition pathways, we consider atarget range more appropriate than a point estimate.

Decarbonising the transport sector will requiregovernment and industry co‑operation to support apolicy framework that promotes a rapid transition tothe availability of electric vehicles, enforces stricterfuel economy standards for internal combustion enginevehicles, and establishes sophisticated electric vehiclecharging infrastructure. Furthermore, societies will needto see the growth in next generation battery technology,decarbonisation of the electricity grid and broaderchanges in consumer behaviour and preferences. The UNPRI commissioned IPR RPS assumes that the Australian

passenger car and van fleet will increase by 37 per cent

by 2050.



Activities in scope



Our analysis covers our vehicle finance business in BFS,

namely passenger cars and light commercial vehicles

offered in Australia.



Product scope in this sector includes consumer loans,commercial loans, and novated leases.



Measuring emissions



In line with the PCAF Standard, we include Scope 1 andScope 2 emissions for vehicles we finance:55• Scope 1: emissions from fuel combustion for internal

combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and plug‑in hybrid

electric vehicles (PHEVs); and

• Scope 2: emissions from electricity used to charge

electric vehicles (EVs) and PHEVs.

The Australian vehicle emissions testing regime islimited to CO 2; however, to capture carbon equivalents,the emissions calculation has been expanded to alsoinclude methane and nitrous oxide from tailpipeemissions. Refer to Appendix 2 for further details onemissions calculations.

Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 42

2030 interim target



We have set a sector target using physical emissionsintensity, as this enables us to continue to supportthe Australian economy’s transition to zeroemission vehicles.

To derive a pathway based on the UN PRI commissionedIPR RPS, we used CO2 emissions per car to obtainthe emissions reduction rate required for our sectorportfolio alignment to 2050. Currently this scenario doesnot consider transport emissions on a per kilometrebasis. We therefore assumed that the average distancetravelled by car remains constant year‑on‑year,which is a conservative assumption, as the AustralianGovernment projections56 suggest there is likely to be aminor reduction in the near term.



Based on the UN PRI commissioned IPR RPS net zero

pathway, we estimate a physical emissions intensity

reduction target of 34 per cent by 2030 from our

baseline.57 We believe this is achievable and we willcontinue to communicate our strategy and actions infuture disclosures. However, our ability to meet ourtarget will be subject to government and industrysupport for:• Greening the electricity grid via renewableenergy sources.• Setting EV sales targets so that the community canwork towards the transition in an orderly manner andsupply and infrastructure can meet relevant demand.• Vehicle manufacturers to maximise ICE vehicle

efficiency and fuel standards in the immediate term,

to enable the transition, and increase supply of EVs.



56. Australia’s emissions projections 2021.57. While scenario emissions per car data combined with Australian Government data on average distance travelled per car suggests that our baseline portfolio emissionsintensity is below the scenario sector average intensity, the baseline year (2020) for Macquarie and the UN PRI commissioned IPR RPS scenario have been aligned to reflect thescenario‑projected emissions target reduction rate over time due to limitations in distance travelled data.

Lending refers to loan assets held at amortised cost and excludes certain items such as leasing, asset finance, trading assets and short‑term financing (e.g., inventory finance).60. IEA (2021), World Energy Outlook 2021, IEA, Paris.



Sector overview



Coal is the most carbon‑intensive fossil fuel and is

estimated to account for around 30 per cent of all GHG

emissions globally. 58 Net zero scenarios that meet moreambitious climate goals generally feature a rapid declinein coal use. Across the scenarios recently assessed bythe IPCC that are consistent with 1.5°C of warming withno or limited overshoot, the median reduction in coal

usage was 75 per cent by 2030 and 95 per cent by 2050

(relative to 2019).



Activities in scope



In 2021 we announced our intention to run‑off our

limited remaining on‑balance sheet lending59 and equityexposures to coal companies by 2024. This commitmentapplies to coal companies in both the mining and

coal‑fired power generation sectors and to metallurgical

and thermal coal.

At the time of the 2021 coal commitment, we followedthe then standard industry practice of classifying clients

as coal companies based on ANZSIC and GICS codes.

However, over the past year the market has evolved,

with NZBA guidance now focused on the proportion

of a company’s revenue that comes from coal‑related

activities. Consequently, we now define a coal company

based on the proportion of its revenue derived fromcoal‑related activities.

Given computational challenges associated with revenueshares (particularly in a world of high and volatile coal

prices), we define a coal company as one that derives

the majority (i.e., more than 50 per cent) of its revenuefrom coal (both thermal and metallurgical) production,

mine ownership or operation, or coal‑fired power

station ownership or operation. We acknowledge that

the 50 per cent threshold is not in line with the NZBAGuidelines, which define a coal company as one that

derives more than 5 per cent of revenues directly fromthermal coal. However, Macquarie has committed not toenter into new business activity with any counterparty

where the underlying purpose is to fund the purchase,

development or expansion of a coal mine or coal‑fired

power station.

The global community has recognised the urgent needto reduce global carbon emissions and the importanceof working with carbon‑intensive industries, such as coal,to help them decarbonise. Given this, going forward wewill maintain the ability to work with coal companies to

finance projects that will significantly reduce their GHG

emissions in line with science‑based scenarios, or are forthe purpose of diversifying away from the coal sector inline with a credible transition plan.



For the purpose of net zero planning, coal‑fired power

generation and coal mining need to be analysed

separately, due to differences in financed emissions

methodologies. In this Report, we present historicalemissions for coal mining, noting that this sectorrepresented most of our limited equity and lendingexposures to coal in FY2020. Next year, we are aimingto include analysis of historical emissions in the powergeneration sector, which will include our small exposure

to coal‑fired power generation.



Measuring emissions



The portfolio emissions include our clients’ Scope 1, 2and Scope 3 emissions (use of sold products, i.e., CO2from combustion), based on client level data, whereavailable. Approximately 40 per cent of our clients in

this sector reported their Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Forclients that did not report Scope 1 and 2 emissions,

these were estimated based on production data andaverage emissions intensities from clients that reported

data. Scope 3 emissions were estimated based on

client reported production data and weighted averageemissions intensities from the IEA’s World EnergyOutlook 2021.60

Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 44

2024 target



In line with our pre‑existing commitment to run‑off our limited remaining on‑balance sheet lending and equityexposure to coal companies, our target is to reach zero absolute financed emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) in the coal

sector by the end of 2024. This target does not include any emissions associated with potential projects that will

significantly reduce GHG emissions in line with science‑based scenarios or are for the purpose of diversifying away

from the coal sector in line with a credible transition plan. In addition to this target, we present historical emissionsfor coal mining.

Data quality and future evolution of our methodology



Estimating emissions baselines requires the collection and analysis of large sets of new data and, as mentioned, there are significantchallenges with both data availability and quality. We therefore produce some of our estimates based on assumptions and extrapolations.Given the urgency of climate action, we are disclosing baselines and targets based on current methodologies despite these datalimitations. In making the data quality related determinations, we have applied the PCAF Standard data quality hierarchies. Refer to

Appendix 2 for further details on data quality determinations.

The data and models used in our methodology are subject to Macquarie’s data governance policies and frameworks.

We will continue to assess available third‑party data and service providers and refine our methodology and data collection andanalysis capabilities.

Over time, we expect that the availability and quality of the data will improve. As a result, we may periodically restate our baselineemissions and, possibly, our emissions reduction targets. While a lag may occur in the progress made against any recalibratedtargets, we are committed to pursuing the best data and modelling capabilities available and transparently updating our calculations,as necessary.

Overview of investment in climate solutions



61. GW of green energy assets reflect 100 per cent generating capacity of each asset, not the proportion owned/managed by Macquarie. For detailed definitions and methodology,refer to Appendix 3.62. This is included in the total $A invested, committed or arranged in green energy assets in the past five years to 31 March 2022.



In 2021, we committed to increase investment in climatemitigation and adaptation solutions. The table belowshows the data we have tracked for FY2022.

In FY2022, we saw a reduction in capital invested from

Macquarie’s balance sheet compared to prior financial

years. This is partly because the Green InvestmentGroup’s (GIG) investment strategy has shifted from the

financing of the construction of projects to investing

during the development phase. While investing duringdevelopment is higher risk and generally viewed ashigh value in the context of the energy transition, it isgenerally less capital intensive.

In 2022, GIG was moved from Macquarie Capital(MacCap) to Macquarie Asset Management (MAM)with the explicit intent of utilising GIG’s asset creation

capabilities for the benefit of MAM clients. While this

enables higher volumes of overall capital deployment,over time this will lead to further reductions in capitalinvested from Macquarie’s balance sheet when measuredon a consistent basis with previous disclosures.

Our ambition is to maintain and grow our role as aleading supporter of green energy and other climatesolutions around the globe.

We expect many of our projects under management tocome into operation over the coming years, supportedby continued improvement in green energy economicsand supportive policy environments. However, severalimportant markets, notably in Europe, have challengingproject development conditions, grid connectionbottlenecks and high degrees of competition. As a result,

setting a quantified target for our climate solutions

investment (either on our balance sheet or underMacquarie management) over the coming years is notpractical in the current environment.

In the years ahead, we expect to see increases acrosseach of the metrics below as the decisions andactions set out in Section 4 — Implementation andengagement take further effect.

Governance

Macquarie’s Boards (as defined below) and management

recognise the importance of sound Environmental,Social and Governance (ESG) practices as part of theirresponsibility to our clients, shareholders, communities,

staff, and the environment in which Macquarie operates.



Climate change is one of Macquarie’s eight ESG focus areas and is core to our business and risk managementpractices. We have therefore integrated oversight of climate risks and opportunities throughout our governancestructure, including at the highest level.

on progress and providing guidance on next steps.

Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 48

The Risk Management Group (RMG) is an independentgroup responsible for objective review and challenge,oversight, monitoring and reporting in relation toMacquarie’s material risks. When new or evolving risks

such as climate risk are identified, the impacted areas

of the RMF are assessed and adjusted where required

to ensure the risks are managed effectively. In addition

to the oversight activities performed by RMG, theInternal Audit Division (IAD) provides independent

and objective risk‑based assurance to the Board AuditCommittee, other relevant Board Committees and seniormanagement on the compliance with, and effectiveness

of, Macquarie’s RMF. IAD regularly reassesses emergingrisks, regulations and trends to ensure that these areadequately captured within the internal audit plan. Inaddition, it is intended that the internal audit plan willprovide ongoing, periodic assurance over the governance

and progress of Macquarie’s Net Zero and Climate

Risk Program.

Last year, to support senior management with theseresponsibilities and drive progress, Macquarieestablished a dedicated centralised cross‑Group

Net Zero and Climate Risk Program (the Program).

Reporting to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and led by

the Head of Net Zero, the central Program teamprovides a consistent and coordinated approach tonet zero and to climate risk across Macquarie, aligningto existing approval forums and bodies. The Programbuilds on established capabilities within each operatinggroup, all of which have dedicated teams involved indriving solutions with and for their clients. The CROis responsible for the successful achievement of the

Program’s objectives, while the Head of Net Zero isresponsible for the day‑to‑day Program operations. Bothwork closely with the Executive Committees, Boards,

and Macquarie’s RMG Environmental and Social Risk(ESR) team.

Supporting the Program is the Net Zero andClimate Risk Steering Group. This body has seniorrepresentatives from each operating and supportgroup, who are responsible for driving outcomes andsteering decisions relevant to the Program. They providesupport to the various working groups and to seniormanagement in decision‑making.



Work to meet our net zero commitments

Aligning our financing activities with the global goalof net zero emissions by 2050: To achieve our netzero ambition, Macquarie has established the FinancedEmissions Working Group. This includes representativesfrom across operating and support groups to enablethe development of approaches, methodologies,frameworks, and governance required to deliver onour commitment. Each operating group has dedicatedresources responsible for analysing industry sectorsapplicable to their group, quantifying emissions,assessing targets, and developing strategies and actionsto meet those targets.



Net zero emissions in our own business operationsby 2025 (Scope 1 and 2): Macquarie’s Corporate

Operations Group (COG) leads our efforts to reach

net zero emissions in our own business operations.COG has a dedicated governance model to support

these efforts, reporting into Macquarie Group’s ChiefOperating Officer. COG’s Business Services Division leads

the execution of Macquarie’s 2025 Sustainability Plan

and net zero efforts in collaboration with Macquarie’s

other functions. Regular progress updates are provided

to the Boards, Executive Committees, and Net Zero and

Climate Risk Steering Group to ensure coordination ofapproaches across Macquarie and enable visibility andsupport where needed.



Investing and managing MAM’s portfolio in line with

global net zero emissions by 2040: Macquarie’s AssetManagement Group (MAM) is working to manageits portfolio in line with global net zero emissions by2040\. MAM has a dedicated governance structure,

which supports these efforts as part of MAM’s broader

sustainability strategy. MAM’s Chief Sustainability

Officer reports to the MAM Group Head and is a

member of MAM’s Executive Committee. MAM’sSustainability Team is responsible for setting MAM’soverall sustainability strategy and ESG framework,provides specialist expertise and supports portfolio andasset management teams in implementing MAM’s netzero program and provides regular progress reports toMAM’s Executive Committee. The MAM SustainabilityTeam works together with other MAM specialist teams,RMG’s ESR and the Program teams. More informationon MAM’s ESG governance is provided in the MAM 2021Sustainability Report.

Work to operationalise climate riskmanagement



There are clear roles and responsibilities acrossMacquarie with respect to climate risk managementand a well‑established Environmental and Social Risk(ESR) function. The ESR team comprises subject matterexperts who coordinate a diverse range of ESG activitiesacross operating and support groups and regions,including developing and implementing Macquarie‑wide

and group‑specific policies, reviewing transactions,

providing advice on climate risks and opportunities, andfacilitating training.

The Climate Risk Working Group provides an additionallevel of oversight of climate risk management. EachRMG division is represented on the Climate Risk Working

Group, which reports to the Head of Net Zero. This

ensures appropriate senior leadership oversight andmanagement of climate risk and the program ofactivities to mature our operationalisation of climaterisk across our risk management frameworks, policies,and procedures. The Climate Risk Working Groupis supported by dedicated resourcing across our

compliance and regulatory affairs teams, which engage

in well‑established processes to conduct regulatoryhorizon scanning and triage, as referenced in

Section 7 — Risk management.

In MAM, our investment teams and portfolio companymanagement team have access to a range of tools and

frameworks to enable ESG risks to be identified and

monitored, including in relation to both the physicaland transition risks from climate change. As disclosed

in the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) Initial

Target Disclosure Report dated May 2022, MAM has

committed to manage 43 per cent of its assets under

management (including 100 per cent of its infrastructureand agriculture portfolios and more than 80 per centof its real estate portfolio) in line with applicable Paris

Aligned Investment Initiative Net Zero Investment

Framework methodologies.



Work to pursue climate opportunities



Since 2017, Macquarie’s Global Green Committee haspromoted and advanced cross‑Group collaboration onpractical climate solutions. In 2022, the Global GreenCommittee was renamed as the Macquarie ClimateSolutions Taskforce (CST). CST has representativesfrom all operating and support groups and is working tosupport Macquarie’s expansion into new climate‑alignedtechnologies such as hydrogen and CCUS as well asMacquarie’s ambition to strengthen the support itprovides to carbon‑intensive industries and clients,like the oil/gas sector. The CST is supported by a

Climate Intelligence Unit (CIU) formed in 2021. TheCIU provides expert support across Macquarie on cleantechnologies, market developments and cross‑Groupclient opportunities.



Finally, the following climate capabilities are wellestablished across Macquarie. This allows the Program

to leverage internal expertise:

• CGM Energy Transition Steering Committee• CGM Global Carbon business• GIG Green Analytics Team• MAM Sustainability Team• Green Law Community (internal employee network ongreen law and regulation)• Green@Macquarie (internal employee network onsustainability issues with over 2,600 members)• BFS Environmental Sustainability Employee

Riskmanagement

Macquarie’s Risk Management Framework



Macquarie’s Risk Management Framework (RMF) is the totality of systems,structures, policies, processes, and people within Macquarie that identify, measure,

monitor, report, and control or mitigate internal and external sources of material

risk. It is underpinned by the following elements:



Risk appetite

Risk appetite is the nature and amount of risk that Macquarie is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and businessplan and is detailed in the Board‑approved Risk Appetite Statement (RAS). Risk tolerances, expressed as qualitative statements andquantitative limits or thresholds, are established to ensure that we only accept risks that are consistent with our risk appetite.

Risk Management Strategy

Macquarie’s Risk Management Strategy (RMS) describes the key elements of our RMF, material risks faced by Macquarie and ourapproach to managing these risks.

Risk Taxonomy

The Risk Taxonomy is a comprehensive hierarchy of risks faced by Macquarie, which distinguishes between risk causes, events,and impacts.



Climate risk



In FY2022, Macquarie continued to enhance

identification, assessment, monitoring, management,

and reporting of climate risks across our RMF. Climatechange and net zero transition were incorporated aslevel 2 causal risks under External Risk and Strategic

Business Risk, respectively, within Macquarie’s RAS, RMS,



and Risk Taxonomy. This ensures qualitative updatesare provided to senior management. We acknowledgethe risks associated with climate change are complexand pervasive. We seek to identify, assess, monitor, andmanage these risks, including through scenario analysis.

Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 52

Consideration of climate risks within Macquarie’s existing risk functions



Aligning with regulatory guidance, Macquarie considers the financial and non‑financial risks arising from physical

climate risk, transition climate risk and liability climate risk drivers.



Physical risk Transition risk Liability risk

Physical climate risk includes thechronic risk arising from progressiveshifts in climate patterns and theacute risk presented by changes to thefrequency and magnitude of extremeweather events.

Transition climate risk includes riskarising directly or indirectly fromthe process of (orderly or disorderly)adjustment towards a lower‑carbonand more environmentally sustainableeconomy, including changes in policyand regulatory settings, technologicalinnovation, social adaptation, andmarket changes.

Liability climate risk arises from thepotential for litigation or regulatoryenforcement due to the failure toadequately consider or respond to theimpacts of climate change.



Potential impacts on Macquarie’s operations, clients, and assets



• Reduced revenues from productionoutages• Remediation and repair costs• Reduction in asset values due to physicalclimate threats

• Reduced revenues from shifts in demandor the introduction of carbon pricing• Additional costs and capital expendituresto fund transition plans, includingresearch \& development• Reduction in asset values or strandedassets due to transition risks

• Litigation and regulatory related costsand liabilities



Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 53

Macquarie treats climate risk as a cross‑cutting risk. This means that we recognise the impact climate risk may haveon other material risk types within our RMF, as illustrated in the following table:63



Risk type Examples of potential climate impacts

Risk identification and

management processes

Equity/Credit Where Macquarie has a direct interest in an asset, the potentialfinancial impacts correspond with those described on theprior page. For loan exposures, the impacts on our clients canresult in:• Loan defaults• Decline in value of assets used as collateral• Increase in utilisation of credit facilities

• Credit portfolio analysis and transactiondue diligence for high‑emitting sectors andclients. These processes will continue tomature, with analysis underway to considernext steps in this evolution.• Physical and transition risk scenario analysis(refer to Scenario analysis section onpage 56).



Environmental\& Social

There is a risk of reputational or financial impacts due tofailure to identify or manage material environmental or socialissues arising from climate risks impacting on our investment,financing, client activities or supply chain.

• Implementation of the Environmental andSocial Risk (ESR) Policy (refer to policy detailson page 55).



Work Health\& Safety

The risk of incidence of work‑related injury, illness or diseaseor other events impacting health and safety of employees,contractors, visitors, and members of the public is heightenedby physical climate risks.

• Implementation of the Work Health andSafety (WHS) Policy.



Asset/Market Reduction in market value of Macquarie’s assets and liabilities,or an increase in the volatility of interest rates, foreignexchange rates, equity prices, and commodity prices.• Physical and transition risk scenario analysis(refer to Scenario analysis section onpage 56).



Operational Increased frequency and impact of extreme weather eventscould result in greater operational disruption at one or moreMacquarie business locations.• Physical risk scenario analysis undertaken inFY2021 to assess the operational resilience ofour business operations.



Regulatory \&Compliance/Legal/Conduct



Climate risk increases litigation and regulatory enforcementrisk, and the likelihood of reputational damage due to failureto comply with current or emerging climate risk regulations ormarket expectations. This includes the risk of real or perceivedmisrepresentation during the creation of new products andpublic disclosures.

• Conduct Management and Code of Conduct.• Global horizon scanning and triage activities(refer to Climate regulation section onpage 55).



Strategic Strategic risk is the risk of Macquarie’s business model beinginadequate in the medium to long‑term. Transition climate riskdirectly impacts Macquarie’s strategic risk.• Strategic/business risk is managed throughMacquarie’s annual strategy and businessplanning process. The business is responsiblefor regularly reassessing their businessstrategy and the potential risk arising fromtheir strategy.

63. This table is not an exhaustive list of risk types or climate impacts, rather demonstrative examples.



Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 54

Macquarie Environmentaland Social Risk (ESR) Policy



Our approach to managing climate risk is alsounderpinned by Macquarie’s group‑wide ESR Policy,which describes our approach to ESR managementwhen onboarding or reviewing clients and othercounterparties and across a broad range of transactions

including equity investments, financing, leasing, and

advisory mandates. The ESR Policy provides a robustprocess for embedding environmental and social riskmanagement into investment decision‑making. It takesa precautionary approach to ESR issues and providesdecision‑making and approval processes, alongside thestandard credit approval process, for escalating matterswith material environmental and social risks, including

climate change risks, to the Chief Risk Officer, MGL andMBL Executive Committees or MGL and MBL Boards.



Macquarie Asset Management’s (MAM) Environmental,Social and Governance (ESG) related policies, whichset out its approach to ESG risk management,align with the Macquarie‑wide ESR Policy and areadapted to MAM’s business. MAM reports at least

semi‑annually to Macquarie’s Boards on compliance

with the Macquarie ESR Policy and other Macquarierequirements. Further details are set out in the MAM2021 Sustainability Report.



Climate regulation



In line with existing roles and responsibilities, establishedfunctions within the Risk Management Group (RMG)provide dedicated global horizon scanning and triageactivities for climate regulation (both prudential andnon‑prudential), as well as oversight and challenge onthe resultant management of any changes.

These functions are of heightened importance givenincreased expectations from regulators and industrybodies on how institutions are managing climaterisk. Given the rapid evolution of standards and bestpractices, Macquarie welcomes moves by regulators,and governments alike, to support increased guidanceto enable consistent reporting and approaches acrossthe industry.

To further support the ongoing assessment and adoptionof regulatory needs and expectations, and to enabletimely action, the RMG Climate Risk Working Grouphas been established (see Section 6 — Governance fordetail). Comprising members of each RMG division, theClimate Risk Working Group provides an additional levelof oversight of climate risk management.



Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 55

Scenario analysis



Over the past few years, Macquarie has conducted the following scenario analysis to implement the Task Force onClimate‑related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and identify and assess our exposure to physical andtransition risks:64

64. Refer to prior TCFD reports for full detail on scenario analysis completed in 2019, 2020 and 2021.65. Analysis included exposures to coal producers and traders.



Scenario analysis conducted in FY2020 indicated theimpacts of transition risk in relation to Macquarie’sexposures to the coal, oil/gas, metals and mining andpower generation sectors would not be consideredmaterial given the diverse nature of Macquarie’sportfolio, the short time horizon of our exposures(compared to those of the transition scenarios), andthe limited size of our existing lending exposure toeach sector.

Equally, physical risk scenario analysis conducted inFY2020 (Macquarie’s residential mortgages portfolio)

and FY2021 (prototypical assets in the offshore and

onshore wind farm, oil/gas extraction and storage,thermal waste generation and combined cycle gasturbine industries) based on assets on Macquarie’s

balance sheet at the time concluded that the quantified

impacts from both acute and chronic climate changewere projected to be minimal.

Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 56

In FY2022, scenario analysis focused on:



For MBL: APRA’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment

(CVA), which MBL participated in alongside the four

largest Australian banks. The CVA focused on the

following over a 30‑year time frame under two NGFSclimate scenarios — “delayed transition” and “currentpolicies”, with additional modelling for the Australian

context:• transition and physical climate risks to MBL’s

residential mortgage portfolio in Australia;• transition risk to MBL’s Australian business

lending portfolio;• a bottom‑up assessment of transition and physical

risks to 25 select Australian counterparties of MBL; and

• balance sheet projections and assessment of a rangeof qualitative questions for non‑credit risk types.

The CVA aided our organisation‑wide understanding of

climate scenarios and their potential financial impacts,

further developed our climate risk modelling capabilities,and assisted in extending our ability to assess the impactof climate risks on individual counterparties. Last monthAPRA released a report summarising the aggregated,anonymised results of the CVA.



For Macquarie’s Irish Credit Institution, MBE: aninternal analysis of the impact of transition and physical

risks on MBE’s risk profile was conducted. The analysisconcluded that MBE was not exposed to near‑term

material risks arising from the physical and transitionscenarios considered.

The capabilities developed through these activitiessupport Macquarie in evolving our understanding ofclimate risk and its consideration as part of ongoingstress testing and scenario analysis activities.



Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) has also completed a comprehensive physical climate risk assessment across its realassets and real estate portfolios. With over 160 portfolio companies and around 500 properties the review assessed over 1,500geographical locations for exposure to physical risk events, including but not limited to, potential impacts of floods, extremetemperature, drought, and wildfires under the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.The risks were assessed for 2021, 2030 and 2050. The review complements the physical risk assessments conducted as part ofstandard acquisition due diligence by the investment and sustainability teams, the outputs of which highlight potential shortand long‑term risks and inform adaptation and mitigation measures, which should be considered.



Climate risk reporting



As outlined in Section 6 — Governance, we ensure our

Board Governance and Compliance Committees receive

bi‑annual updates through ESR’s Material Risk Reportand additional interim updates as required. These

provide the Boards with material period‑on trends in riskprofile and a view of the effectiveness of the ESR risk

management framework. We continue to improve ourinternal reporting to management — we have qualitativeinclusions in our risk management framework and arenow developing quantitative measures. Where targets

are set for our financed emissions sectors, these will beembedded into our strategy, Board risk reporting, and

risk management practices.

In addition to internal reporting, we will continue toalign our external disclosures with the TCFD Guidelines,related emerging industry best practices and otherreporting commitments such as those set out in the

Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) Guidelines and NetZero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) in the context of

MAM. We will also continue to participate in voluntaryexternal benchmarking initiatives and surveys, as ameans of staying connected to industry best practiceand monitoring our maturity.

Next steps

08

We are proud of our track record in drivingdecarbonisation solutions for our clients and ourcommunities. However, we recognise that our

commitment to align our financing activities with

the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050 willrequire us to build on the progress to date.

The publication of this Report is an important milestone in the evolution of Macquarie’s commitment to acton climate change. It sets out the detail on our new targets and provides a comprehensive overview of ourimplementation and engagement in four key areas of action.• Increase our investment in climate mitigation andadaptation solutions.• Strengthen our support for clients andportfolio companies to help achieve theirdecarbonisation ambitions.

• Continue to reduce the emissions of our ownbusiness operations.• Align our financing activities with the global goal of

net zero emissions by 2050.

We will continue to work to advance the actions we have set out under each of these areas.



Our greatest contribution will remain driving positive and practical climate solutions in line with our corecapabilities. Important next steps include:



Developing and reporting emissionsbaselines, targets, and transition plans forthe remaining carbon‑intensive sectors, inaccordance with the NZBA Guidelines.

Improving the availability and quality ofclimate data used in our sector portfolioassessments by incorporating additionaldatasets, advancing our methodology,and engaging with our clients to obtainmore refined emissions data and insights,as appropriate.

Supporting greater collaboration betweendiverse stakeholders, regulators, and clientsto facilitate a low‑carbon transition.

Delivering on our commitment to investand manage our portfolio in line with globalnet zero emissions by 2040, 10 years aheadof the deadline to achieve the goals of theParis Agreement. This includes increasingthe proportion of real assets portfoliocompanies with net zero business plansin place.

Developing methods to measure andtrack emissions reductions strategiesacross our Scope 3 operational value chainemissions. This includes a continued focuson evolving our carbon offsetting strategyin line with industry guidance. Worktowards developing a longer‑term Scope 3operational value chain emissions reductiontarget aligned to science.

Further integrating climate risk into ourbroader risk management framework,policies and procedures.

PwC has been assuring Macquarie’s Scope 1 emissionssince FY2017 and Scope 2 emissions since FY2010. Referto the FY2020 Independent Limited Assurance Report

section 3 for detailed criteria.



Coverage of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions



Corporate offices and data centres



Macquarie’s corporate offices and data centres aredefined as:

• Offices leased by Macquarie operating entitiesglobally, which are also occupied by Macquarie staff

and have a Net Usable Area (i.e., the area that can be

fitted out by the tenant) of greater than 100m2.• Data centres around the world where Macquarie hasoversight of electricity usage and pays for this usage.



Base buildings



Macquarie’s base buildings are defined as:

• Offices or buildings where Macquarie owns and occupiesthe building. Base building energy refers to the energy

required to operate the mechanical plant, lifts, andlighting in the lobby and other communal areas.



Calculating and measuring Scope 1 and 2

GHG emissions



Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions associated withdiesel, natural gas, and refrigerant usage



Scope 1 emissions for the baseline reporting periodwere estimated by multiplying energy usage by relevantemissions factors from government or internationalsources.

Usage has been sourced directly from meter data andsupplier or landlord invoices, where available.

Where no tank meter readings were available, dieselusage was estimated based on engine performancedata from diesel generator data sheets. For naturalgas, where no invoiced data was available, usage was

estimated based on usage in comparable offices.

For refrigerant gases, usage was estimated based on

refrigerant charge and leakage rates in accordance withthe NGER (Measurement) Determination.66



Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions associated withtotal electricity consumed



The electricity usage data for the baseline reportingperiod was obtained directly from the actual tenancy orbuilding data, where available, and the remaining energyconsumption was estimated by one of the followingprioritised data methodologies:

1\. Extrapolation of actual electricity usage datafrom prior periods, adjusted for any year‑on‑yearoverall movements.2\. Where no electricity invoiced data was available for

an office, estimating electricity consumed for thatoffice based on its net lettable area and the average

electricity consumption per square metre of other

offices in the same region.



Emissions factors from relevant government orinternational sources have then been applied todetermine the equivalent indirect emissions associatedwith electricity consumed.



Coverage of Scope 3 GHG emissions of our ownbusiness operations



Category 1: Purchased goods and services (includingcapital goods, upstream leased assets, and upstreamtransportation and distribution)



This category covers emissions arising from theprocurement of goods and services (includingcapital goods, upstream leased assets and upstreamtransportation and distribution) that are paid for viaMacquarie’s procurement system, and are categorisedaccording to Macquarie’s internal taxonomy codes.This excludes transactions not associated with thepurchase of goods and services and capital goods

where identifiable e.g., intra‑company and payroll

payments, community/charitable donations, andtaxation‑related spend.

Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 61

Category 2: Capital goods



Given the capital goods spend data has been captured inthe calculation methodology for Category 1, emissionsrelated to Category 2 are not reported separately.



Category 3: Fuel‑ and energy‑related activities



This category covers emissions arising from theextraction, production and transportation of fuels andenergy consumed by Macquarie, including transmissionand distribution (T\&D) losses (i.e., generation ofelectricity, steam, heating, and cooling that is consumed(i.e., lost) in a T\&D system including emissions from

combustion). It excludes offices or buildings that are

owned or managed by a Macquarie entity but are not

tenanted by Macquarie staff, and properties for which

we have no control or oversight of electricity usage.



Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution



Given the upstream transportation and distributionspend data has been captured in the calculation

methodology for Category 1, emissions related to

Category 4 are not reported separately.



Category 5: Waste generated in operations



This category covers emissions arising from the disposaland treatment of waste generated in operations.

Exclusions:• e‑waste.• Construction waste.



Category 6: Business travel



The primary source of business‑related travel emissionsdata is Macquarie’s exclusive global corporate creditcard provider, American Express, and includes airtravel, hotels, and ground transport. Additionally, ourcorporate card travel emissions data includes foodand beverage spend for meals while travelling, as wellas other forms of food and beverage spend that may

not be directly related to business travel (e.g., staff or

client entertainment).



Category 8: Upstream leased assets



Given the upstream leased assets spend data hasbeen captured in the calculation methodology forCategory 1, emissions related to Category 8 are notreported separately.



Calculating and measuring Scope 3 GHGemissions of our own business operations



Category 1: Purchased goods and services (includingcapital goods, upstream leased assets, and upstreamtransportation and distribution)



The “spend‑based” method (as per the GHG ProtocolScope 3 Guidance) was used to calculate these

emissions, with industry‑average emissions factorsapplied based on the economic value of the goods andservices and capital goods (upstream leased assets andupstream transportation and distribution) processed viaMacquarie’s procurement system.

Spend data was extracted from Macquarie’sprocurement system, which was categorised accordingto Macquarie’s internal taxonomy codes and uploadedto an emissions calculation platform where emissionsfactors were applied. This platform applies the UnitedStates Environmentally‑Extended Input‑Output (USEEIO)dataset that estimates cradle‑to‑gate GHG emissions foreach given industry or product category.

The corresponding USEEIO emissions factors weremapped against Macquarie’s internal taxonomy and thenapplied to calculate overall emissions for this category.A weighted average emissions factor was applied for anyuncategorised spend.

The latest USEEIO release provides data through to2019, with emissions factors denominated in $US. Thesewere translated to the relevant period (i.e., to MacquarieFY2020) using relative price levels and then to therelevant currency (i.e., from $US to $A) using the periodaverage exchange rate.



Emissions = ∑ Spend by category × converted emissionsfactor by category



Category 2: Capital Goods



Capital goods are covered under Category 1, asdiscussed above.

Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 62

Category 3: Fuel‑ and energy‑related activities



As discussed above, Category 3 includes the total

electricity consumed from Macquarie’s global corporate

offices, data centres and base buildings. Usage is based

on invoice data from energy retailers or landlords, where

available, or estimated based on comparable offices.

For energy consumed in Australia, state‑level emissionsfactors were used, based on the National GreenhouseAccounts Factors published by the Department ofClimate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water(2021). For energy consumed outside of Australia,emissions factors by country were used based on the

UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company

Reporting, DEFRA Emissions Factors (2019).



Emissions = ∑ Quantity of electricity purchased bystate/country × emissions factor by state/country



Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution



Upstream transportation and distribution are coveredunder Category 1, as discussed above.



Category 5: Waste generated in operations



Due to limited data availability, tonnes / FTE wascalculated for sites where data was available,representing approximately 47 per cent of our global

staff. This was then extrapolated out to the remainingpopulation of our staff to estimate global emissions for

waste generated in operations on a per capita basis.

The headcount number excludes staff on extendedleave, staff at a non‑Macquarie office, casual staff and

non‑executive directors. Emissions factors are based

on the UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for

Company Reporting, DEFRA Emissions Factors (2019).



Category 6: Business travel



Air travel, hotels, ground transport and food andbeverage emissions are calculated on the spend‑basedmethodology provided by American Express, ourcorporate card provider, who calculates our carbonfootprint where an American Express card is the formof payment.

Emissions factors from the relevant reporting periodand government or international sources have then beenused to determine the equivalent indirect emissions

associated with air travel (by cabin flown), hotels,

ground transport, and food and beverage spend on thecorporate card program.

The following emissions factors have been applied incalculating GHG emissions (tonnes CO2e) during therelevant period:• Air and Ground: DEFRA Government greenhousegas conversion factors for company reporting:Methodology paper for emission factors (2019–2020).• Hotel: Applies the method defined by Cornell HotelSustainability Benchmarking (CHSB) Index (2019). TheBusiness Travel News Corporate Travel Index was used

to retrieve the average daily room rate to estimatethe number of room nights of hotel stay. The numberof nights was then multiplied by the appropriate

emissions factor provided by CHSB based upon

the class of service of the hotel, provided by SmithTravel Research.• Food and Beverage: United States EPA factors. Wemultiplied the number of meals by an appropriateGHG emissions factor (2020) per meal.



Category 8: Upstream leased assets



Upstream leased assets are covered under Category 1,as discussed above.

Appendix 2: Methodologyfor Macquarie Group’s

financed emissions



67. Refer to page 6 for further details of product inclusion and exclusion.68. A midpoint of 32 has been used as a conversion factor, based on the IEA Methane Tracker, where 1 tonne of methane is reported to be equivalent to 28–36 tonnes of CO2 whenlooking at the warming impact over 100 years. Refer to IEA (2022), Global Methane Tracker 2022, IEA, Paris.



Additional notes on methodology



In addition to the methodology decisions described in

Section 5 — Metrics and targets, below we providemore details on our methodology.



Scope:



Our current product scope, in line with the NZBA

Guidelines, includes on‑balance sheet lending and equityinvestment activities.67 This means that certain typesof investments, e.g., the underlying investment vehiclesmanaged by Macquarie Asset Management, are notin scope. However, we have also included some otherproducts, where methodology and data is available.For example, in the motor vehicle sector, we focused

on asset finance activity, which includes lending and

novated leases. The breadth of the business activities

covered by our net zero plan for financed emissions

includes the on‑balance sheet activities of both thebanking and non‑banking businesses of Macquarie.



In defining organisational boundaries (e.g., entity

inclusion), Macquarie applies an operational control

approach, as defined in the GHG Protocol.



Metrics:



When reporting emissions, we report in carbon dioxideequivalents (CO2e) to account for other GHGs wherethey are material, e.g., methane emissions associatedwith oil/gas production. For the coal and oil/gas sectors,methane emissions were converted to CO 2e based on100‑year emissions factors published by the IEA.68 For

motor vehicles, given the Australia‑specific nature of this

business, non‑CO2 gases were converted based on NGERconversion factors.



Baseline:



Prior to assessing net zero pathways and targets, we

needed to establish our financed emissions baselines

for each in‑scope sector. This is where we made certainmethodological determinations, as outlined below.

Our baseline reporting year is from 1 April 2019 to

31 March 2020 (Macquarie’s financial year 2020,

FY2020) — this takes into consideration potentialdistortions caused by COVID‑19 in FY2021 and to alesser extent in FY2022.

To determine the amount of exposure to a sector and/or client, we use an Exposure at Default (EAD) measure

as at the end of financial year. We use EAD because

it is a well‑recognised and understood data point,which we already use in external regulatory reporting,and is therefore already governed by Macquarie’sdata framework.



All data related to client financial (e.g., economic valueincluding cash) and non‑financial (e.g., production) values

has been aligned to our baseline (FY2020) year‑end dateas closely as possible, i.e., we have taken information as

at the client’s closest financial reporting year‑end date.



For debt exposure, we cover both drawn and committedundrawn components. This ensures a more completeanalysis of our exposure to carbon‑intensive sectors andreduces potential volatility from any scenarios whereclients draw down on the committed portion of existingloan agreements.

Sector‑specific methodology for calculating

emissions



In addition to the sector level methodology decisionsdescribed in Section 5 — Metrics and targets, below

we provide further clarification of our methodology for

each sector.



Oil/gas:



We have considered the full oil/gas sector value chain,including the upstream, midstream, and downstreamsegments. The upstream segment includes explorationand production activities such as drilling wells andextracting oil/gas deposits; the midstream segmentincludes transporting via gas pipelines and storing

oil/gas; and the downstream segment includes refining

crude oil and natural gas into end‑use products suchas gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel that are then sent toenergy providers, gas stations, or other distributors andretail outlets.

We have focused our initial analysis on the upstream

segment, including associated Scope 3 combustion by

end users.

Our methodology for emissions initially relies onemissions reported by our clients, sourced either viapublic databases (e.g., CDP) or reported by clientsdirectly to us. Most emissions sourced via this methodwere given a PCAF data quality score of 2, as they

were not independently verified. We did, however,

scan for results that looked to be inconsistent withindustry benchmarks.



69. IEA (2020), Methane Tracker 2020, IEA, Paris.70. IEA (2021), World Energy Outlook 2021, IEA, Paris.71. BP (2022), bp Statistical Review of World Energy 2022 | 71st Edition, BP p.l.c.



A significant portion of our clients did not report their

Scope 1 and 2 emissions (approximately 50 per centby FY2020 sector exposure) and most of them did not

report their Scope 3 emissions (approximately 90 per

cent by FY2020 sector exposure). In those cases, weestimated our clients’ emissions using client reportedproduction data and weighted emissions intensityfactors using the following publications from the IEA:• Methane Tracker 202069 for Scope 1, 2 emissions.• World Energy Outlook 202170 for Scope 3 emissions.



In estimating our clients’ emissions for Scope 1, 2 ourmethodology covered both CO 2 and methane associated

with production and refining of oil/gas products. ForScope 3, we captured end‑use emissions, namely CO2released into the atmosphere from combustion.

Emissions estimated using this method were given a

data quality score of 3.



Where required, emissions intensities were converted

using the conversion factors from the BP Statistical

Review of World Energy.71

For the remaining exposure, where production dataof our clients was not known, emissions were proxiedusing the average intensity of the portfolio for whichemissions had been calculated. This methodology wasused for approximately 1 per cent of the sector portfolioby exposure and the resultant emissions were given thelowest data quality score of 5.

We attributed our clients’ absolute emissions to Macquarie based on the PCAF Standard:



Financed emissions = ∑ (Client emissions) Client nancing in EADClient EVIC (or Total debt+ Equity, if private company)x



We quantified the oil/gas sector portfolio emissions intensity based on the following formula:



Portfolio weighted average physical emissions intensity = ∑ Client emissionsClient productionClient nancingPortfolio nancing( ( )) x



Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 65

Motor vehicles:



72. National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination 2008.



In the motor vehicle sector, we covered our vehicle

finance business in BFS, namely passenger cars and lightcommercial vehicles offered in Australia. This businessalso finances other vehicle types such as trucks, buses,

motorcycles etc.; however, this is a smaller part ofthe portfolio and may be considered separately in thefuture. In 2021, Macquarie sold its Dealer Wholesalebusiness, therefore that segment of the value chain has

not been included.



Product scope in this sector includes consumerloans, commercial loans, and novated leases. Weincluded novated leases, given their similarity to loans,consistency of the methodology between the two

products, and availability of data.

We have used the PCAF methodology to attribute vehicle emissions to our financing of those vehicles:



Financed emissions = ∑ (Eciencyv,f x Emissions factorf x Distance travelledv x Attribution factorv )



where v = vehicle or vehicle eet; f = fuel type; and Attribution factorv =

v,fEADVTotal value at originationv



Vehicle emissions were calculated based on known

make and model, vehicle efficiency and fuel type data

used as part of the Australian Government Vehicle FuelConsumption Labelling Standard, and the data wassourced from industry sources. Where this was unknownor emissions factors were required to derive CO2e perkm, this information was sourced from government

sources including the ABS Motor Vehicle Usage

Survey and Australian Clean Energy Regulator NGERMeasurement Determination.72



The distance travelled data was sourced from the ABS

Motor Vehicle Usage Survey. It is worth noting that thelatest survey published in 2020 uses a reference periodimpacted by restrictions in movement due to COVID‑19.Therefore, we have not used the data directly from thatsurvey for our FY2020 baseline, and instead derived itusing a growth rate between the data published in 2016and 2018 surveys. This data input in our methodology

will remain constant until a new survey is released.



Should there be changes by the Australian Governmentin the emissions testing regime or data availability, we

will update our methodology accordingly.

We quantified the motor vehicle sector portfolio emissions intensity in gCO2e/km based on the following formula:



Physical emissions intensity =

Total attributed activity = ∑ (Distance travelledv x Attribution factorv )where v

Financed emissionsTotal attributed activity

Coal:



73. IEA (2021), World Energy Outlook 2021, IEA, Paris.74. NGER Publication, October 2020, National Greenhouse Accounts Factors 2022.



In this Report, we analysed historical emissions for thecoal mining segment of the coal sector, noting thatit represented most of our limited equity and lendingexposures to coal in FY2020.



Clients’ Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 (use of sold products,

i.e., CO2 from combustion) emissions were based onclient reported data, where available. Approximately40 per cent of our clients in this sector reported theirScope 1 and 2 emissions, and none reported their

Scope 3 emissions. Reported emissions were given

a PCAF data quality score of 2, as they were not

independently verified.



Where client level data was not available, we estimatedemissions by:• Scopes 1 and 2: multiplying the client reportedproduction data by the average physical emissionsintensity of clients who reported their Scope 1,2 emissions.• Scope 3: multiplying the client reported production

data by the weighted average emissions intensityfrom the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2021.73



Emissions estimated using this method were given a

data quality score of 3.



Where required, emissions intensities were convertedusing conversion factors from the NGER. 74

Data quality and future evolution of our methodology



75. Source: Carbon Accounting Financials, Table 5‑3 and 5‑5.



In making the data quality related determinations, wehave applied the PCAF Standard data quality hierarchies.This approach enables us to rate the quality of datafrom 1 to 5 (highest to lowest), which accounts forvarying levels of uncertainty in our clients’ emissions

data. Refer to the following data quality table, sourcedfrom the PCAF Standard, which has been used to ratethe data quality for baseline emissions in this Report,and which we will use to enhance data quality over time.

Appendix 3: Methodologyfor Macquarie Group’sgreen energy assets



“GW (Gigawatts) of green energy assets on ourbalance sheet or under Macquarie management”

shows the total energy generation capacity of the greenenergy assets that Macquarie has an equity investmentin or that are included in Macquarie’s funds under

management at a specified date. It excludes lending

and private credit funds. The number of GW includes100 per cent generation capacity of each asset, not theproportion owned/managed by Macquarie.

Energy generation capacity is disclosed by three stages

in the project life cycle; “in development”, “underconstruction” or “currently operating”.

Assets are defined to be “in development” if Macquarie

or any portfolio company of a Macquarie managed fund(i) has internally approved the commitment to allocatea meaningful amount of resources (people, funding) toassessing project feasibility (or a portfolio of projects),or made a partnering commitment to pursue a project/

portfolio that is not yet “under construction”; or (ii)

has obtained site control for a particular project. “In

development” excludes those assets that are no longer

active at the reporting date, as well as assets “under

construction” or assets that are “currently operating”.

Assets are defined to be “under construction” when a

project is approved through a Final Investment Decision(FID). FID is the point in the capital project planningprocess when the decision is taken to make major

financial commitments, which will provide the funding

required to commence and complete the constructionof the project to create an operational asset.



Assets are defined to be “currently operating” when

a project has reached Commercial Operation Date(COD). COD is the point in time when the project isfully commissioned, placed into service, and all relevant

parties are satisfied that it can operate as intended.



The amount of “$Ab invested, committed or arrangedin green energy assets” is made up of:• Lending and equity investment made by Macquarieor MAM Private Markets Funds in green energy assets

during the specified period;

• Lending and equity committed to by Macquarie orMAM Private Markets Funds for green energy assets

during the specified period;

• Financing arranged by Macquarie for green energy

assets during the specified period. This comprises of:

– Financing arranged within MAM’s PrivateCredit funds;

– Financing arranged by GIG where GIG has i)invested equity into the project as a joint lead orlead sponsor or as part of a consortium, and ii)played an instrumental role in raising additional

third‑party financing for the project. If both criteriaare met, 100 per cent of the “arranged” third‑party

funding is included.• EV car finance (loans and novated leases). It excludes

other short‑term funding such as trading positions.



For our BFS Car Loans business and CGM Asset Finance

business, funding is only included when it has been

drawn. All other investments are considered “invested”or “arranged” at the point when a legally binding

obligation has been entered into. They are considered

“committed” when Macquarie has internally approved

the commitment.

Macquarie’s definition of green energy assets for thepurpose of this Report, is made up of:• Established renewable energy technologies such assolar, wind, hydro or geothermal energy;• Emerging green energy technologies including greenhydrogen, carbon capture, utilisation and storage(CCUS) and renewable natural gas;• Waste‑to‑energy and bioenergy assets;• Energy efficiency technologies such as smart meters,energy efficient lighting, biomass boilers and ground

and air source heat pumps;• Low carbon transport, including electric vehicles;• Supporting infrastructure for the above assets,

e.g., battery storage and EV charging infrastructure.

with the terms defined in Appendix 5: Glossary of terms.



Management’s responsibilities



The Management of the Group is responsible for theSubject Matter and for the preparation of the SubjectMatter in accordance with the Criteria, applied as

explained in Appendices 1 to 3 of the Report. This

responsibility includes the design, implementationand maintenance of internal control relevant to thepreparation of the Report that is free from materialmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error.



Our Independence and Quality control



We have complied with relevant ethical requirementsrelated to assurance engagements, which includeindependence and other requirements foundedon fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity,

professional competence and due care, confidentiality

and professional behaviour.

In accordance with Auditing Standard ASQC 1 QualityControl for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews ofFinancial Reports and Other Financial Information,Other Assurance Engagements and Related ServicesEngagements the firm maintains a comprehensive

system of quality control including documented policiesand procedures regarding compliance with ethicalrequirements, professional standards and applicablelegal and regulatory requirements.



Our responsibilities



Our responsibility is to express a limited assuranceconclusion based on the procedures we have performedand the evidence we have obtained.

Our engagement has been conducted in accordancewith the Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements

(ASAE 3000) Assurance Engagements Other Than Auditsor Reviews of Historical Financial Information and theAustralian Standard on Assurance Engagements (ASAE

3410) Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse GasStatements. These standards require that we plan andperform this engagement to obtain limited assuranceabout whether anything has come to our attention toindicate that the Subject Matter has not been prepared,in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria,for the Period. The procedures we performed were basedon our professional judgement and included:• Enquiries with management regarding the processand controls for capturing, collating and reporting theSubject Matter;• Agreeing a sample of lending exposures to sourcesystems and comparing their categorisation by

counterparty to the Australian and New ZealandStandard Industrial Classification codes;

• Agreeing a sample of external data used in the

estimation and attribution of Scope 3 operational

emissions to third party sources;• Enquiries with management regarding selectedestimates made in preparing the Subject Matter;• Reperforming a sample of calculations undertakenin preparing the Subject Matter and the appropriateapplication of the Criteria in those calculations;• Reviewing the presentation and disclosure of theSubject Matter and Criteria in the Report; and• With respect to the Financed Emissions data andGreen Energy Capacity Metrics, performing proceduresover the compilation of the data, however our scopedid not include performing assurance procedures overthe underlying data provided by third parties.

Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report 72

The procedures performed in a limited assuranceengagement vary in nature and timing from, and are lessin extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagementand consequently the level of assurance obtained in alimited assurance engagement is substantially lowerthan the assurance that would have been obtainedhad a reasonable assurance engagement beenperformed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable

assurance opinion.



We believe that the evidence we have obtained is

sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for

our conclusion.



Use of report



This report was prepared for the Board of Directors of

Macquarie Group Limited. We disclaim any assumptionof responsibility for any reliance on this report to any

persons or users other than the Board of Directors of

Macquarie Group Limited, or for any purpose other thanthat for which it was prepared.



Inherent limitations ‑ Assurance engagements



Because of the inherent limitations of any assurance

engagement due to the selective testing of theinformation examined, it is possible that fraud, erroror non‑compliance may occur and not be detected. Alimited assurance engagement is not designed to detectall instances of non‑compliance of the Subject Matterwith the Criteria, as it is limited primarily to makingenquiries, of management, and applying analyticalprocedures. The limited assurance conclusion expressedin this report has been formed on the above basis.



Inherent limitations ‑ Subject Matter



Non‑financial information is subject to more inherentlimitations than financial information, given the more

qualitative characteristics of the subject matter andthe methods used for determining conformance. The

absence of a significant body of established practice onwhich to draw to evaluate and measure non‑financialinformation allows for different, but acceptable,measurement techniques and can affect comparability

between entities over time.

As disclosed on page 45 of the Report, it isacknowledged by stakeholders globally, including

regulators, that there are significant limitations in the

availability and quality of emissions data from thirdparties, resulting in the extensive use of proxy data.The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials(PCAF) has established a data quality score to assist inunderstanding the source of data which is incorporatedinto the Group’s Criteria. The limited assuranceconclusion expressed in this report has been formed onthe above basis.



Conclusion



Based on our review, which is not an audit, nothing has

come to our attention that causes us to believe that theSubject Matter has not been prepared, in all materialrespects, in accordance with the Criteria:• for the period 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 foroperational greenhouse gas emissions and financed

greenhouse gas emissions,• as at 31 March 2020 for exposure at default metric,

• as at 31 March 2022 for exposure at default metric,

• for the period 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2022 for

$A billion invested, committed or arranged in greenenergy assets,• for the period 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 for

$A billion invested, committed or arranged in greenenergy assets, and• as at 31 March 2022 and as at 30 September 2022 for

GW of green energy assets currently operating, underconstruction or in development.
