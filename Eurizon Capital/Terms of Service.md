1. INTRODUCTION

As a financial market participant, Eurizon Capital S.A. (henceforth “Eurizon Capital” or the “Company”)

has a fiduciary duty to its Customers and Investors and, more generally, to the other stakeholders that

requires it to effectively deal with the issues relating to sustainability, with reference to the returns on its

financial products and to the issuers in which it invests on behalf of the assets under management. In line

with its own “Engagement policy” the Company believes, in fact, that the issuers implementing high

standards at social, environmental, and corporate governance level are able to generate sustainable

performances over the long term.

This Policy describes the financial instrument selection and monitoring methodologies adopted by the

Company to include the sustainability risk analysis and management1 as part of its decision-making

process on investments relating to collective asset management services and portfolio management and

to the recommendations made within the investment advisory service (“Investment Process”).

Along with these methodologies, the adoption of specific financial instruments selection processes are

foreseen, which are appropriately calibrated based on the characteristics and objectives of the individual

products managed, that take into account environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors,

and principles of Sustainable and Responsible Investments (SRI).

The criteria for selecting and monitoring issuers criteria based on ESG and SRI profiles integrate the

traditional financial analysis of risk/return profiles of issuers that the Company takes into account when

forming its Investment choices, in order to i) avoid environmental, social and governance conditions cause

a significant, actual or potential, significant negative impact on the value of the investments of managed

assets and ii) lever the capabilities of issuers to benefit from sustainable growth opportunities .

This document represents the Summary of the Policy for the integration of the sustainability risks in the

Investment Process of Eurizon Capital pursuant to pursuant to Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088

of the European Parliament and of the Council on information on sustainability in the financial services

sector (so called “Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation” or “SFDR Regulation”) and the related

implementing regulations.



This document also describes how Eurizon Capital takes into account:

- the main negative effects of investment decisions on sustainability factors pursuant to Article 43 and

74 of the SFDR Regulation and the related implementing regulations;

- sustainability risks in its Remuneration and Incentive Policy, pursuant to Article 55 of the SFDR

Regulation.

The regulatory framework was further extended by the European legislator through the following

provisions:

- Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (the 'Taxonomy Regulation') on the establishment of a framework for

sustainable investment;

- Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1253 concerning the integration of client sustainability

preferences by investment firms;

- Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1269 concerning the integration of sustainability

factors into product governance requirements;



1 i.e. the occurrence of an event or an environmental, social or governance condition that may cause a significant actual or potential

negative impact on the investment value.

2 Financial market participants publish information on their websites about their policies on integrating sustainability risks into their

investment decision-making processes. Financial advisors shall publish on their websites information about their policies on integrating

sustainability risks into their investment or insurance advice.

3 Financial market participants shall publish and update on their websites where they consider the main adverse effects of investment

decisions on sustainability factors, a statement regarding their due diligence policies with respect to such effects, taking due account of

their size, the nature and scope of their activities and the type of financial products they make available.

4 [omission] for each financial product, if a financial market participant applies Article 4 [omission], the following shall be included: a) a

clear and reasoned explanation of whether, and, if so, how a financial product considers principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors;

b) a statement that information on principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors is available in the information to be disclosed pursuant

to Article 11(2) of the Regulation.

5 Financial market participants and financial advisors include in their remuneration policies information about how those policies are

consistent with the integration of sustainability risks and post that information on their websites.

standards on the content and presentation of information in pre-contractual documents, websites and

2. EURIZON’S COMMITMENT TO THE SUSTAINABILITY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES

The Vision and the Mission of Eurizon Capital emphasise the importance for all the companies belonging

to the Asset Management Division of Intesa Sanpaolo Group to co-operate with the companies in which

it invests to promote rules and conducts that privilege the sustainability aspects of the investments and

encourage high governance standards of the investee issuers.

Eurizon Capital believes that those companies that take the ESG factors into account in their own

strategies and operational models are more likely to achieve sustainable profits over time and thus of

increasing their value, both economically and financially.

The following diagram shows the key stages of the engagement evolution of the Asset Management

Division regarding ESG and SRI issues, since 1996, i.e. the year that the first Ethical funds were marketed

by Eurizon Capital SGR S.p.A. on the Italian market:



In this context, the Company promotes conducts that favour sustainability aspects of investments and the

adoption of good corporate governance practices by investee issuers on behalf of the managed assets.

The next sections describe the Codes, Principles and Initiatives endorsed by the Parent Company

Eurizon Capital SGR, in order to adopt ethical standards and codes of responsible company conduct

which are internationally recognised.



2.1. THE CODE OF ETHICS

The Intesa Sanpaolo Group’s Code of Ethics aims to guide behaviour consistent with the highest national

and international standards of ethics. The Code includes and recognises sustainability principles as

fundamental for steering its business strategy and for having a positive impact on the future of the planet

and company, aware that its consideration of social and environmental factors contributes to minimising

exposure to risks and to consolidating its reputation.



2.2. UNITED NATIONS' PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT (UN PRI)

The integration of ESG factors and SRI principles, in addition to responding to the reference principles

and the values of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group and the Asset Management Division, is connected with the

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 5 of 29



Company’s endorsement since 2015 of the “Principles for Responsible Investment”, the guiding principles

concerning responsible investments promoted by the United Nations.

As a signatory of the Principles for Responsible Investment, the Asset Management Division is committed

to:

1. incorporate environmental, social and corporate governance factors into its investment analysis and

decision-making process;

2. integrate environmental, social and corporate governance factors in the active ownership policy;

3. requesting the companies it invests in to provide appropriate disclosure on information about

environmental, social and corporate governance factors concerning them;

4. promote the acceptance and implementation of the Principles in the investment community;

5. work with the financial community to improve the effectiveness in implementing the Principles;

6. disclose to the public the reports on activities and progress of the Company in applying the Principles.

The Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR S.p.A. is required to provide annually information on its

responsible investment activities, by taking part in the “Reporting and Assessment”, available on the

website www.unpri.org, for the whole asset management division.

Lastly, in October 2023, the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR S.p.A. joined the initiative “Sustainable

Systems Investment Manager Reference Group” promoted by UN PRI with the aim of encouraging

regular engagement and discussion with asset management companies.



2.3. STEWARDSHIP PRINCIPLES

As a member – since 2014 – of the "Italian Stewardship Principles" for the exercise of administrative and

voting rights in listed companies defined by Assogestioni6, the Company pays particular attention to the

policies implemented by the issuers, stimulating comparison with the companies in which it invests.

The principles defined by Assogestioni are aligned with those outlined in the ‘Stewardship Code’

promoted by the European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA), in which Assogestioni

participates and of which Eurizon Capital is also a member, in order to promote, at European level, the

development of good corporate governance practices.

In this context, the Company:

1. Adopts a documented policy, available to the public, setting out the strategy for exercising the

rights concerning financial instruments of managed portfolio and UCIs;

2. Monitors listed investee issuers;

3. Sets out clear guidelines on the time frames and intervention procedures in listed issuers in

which it invests in order to protect and increase their value;

4. Considers the possibility of a collaboration with other institutional investors, where appropriate,

paying particular attention to regulations governing joints actions;

5. Exercises the voting rights attached to the financial instruments pertaining to the UCIs and the

managed portfolio in an informed manner;

6. Track of the exercise of the rights inherent in financial instruments pertaining to the UCIs and

managed portfolios, adopting a policy on the disclosure of information on external governance.

In order to regulate the behaviours that the Company adopts to stimulate comparison engagement with

the issuers in which it invests, integrating its own commitment as a shareholder in the investment strategy,

the Company has defined its own “Engagement Policy", in compliance with Luxembourg Law 1 August

2019, Art. 1er Sexies.

Eurizon Capital SA has also adopted, in compliance with sector regulations7, the “Strategy for exercising

participating and voting rights concerning the financial instruments of managed UCIs” to guarantee



6 The Principles defined by Assogestioni - the Italian professional association of which Eurizon Capital S.A. is a member - are aligned with

those in the EFAMA Code for External Governance approved by the European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA) in

which Assogestioni participates.

7 Art. 1 quarter, 1 quinquies, 1 octies, Art. 2 of Lux Law 1 August 2019 and Art. 37 of EU Reg. 231/2013

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 6 of 29



independence and autonomy exercise of participation and voting rights, when such rights are assigned

for managed investments on a discretionary basis.

The Company monitors the effectiveness of the measures taken for engagement with issuers and the

exercise of voting rights by reviewing the Strategy and the Engagement Policy at least annually. The

Company provides transparent information on these documents at www.eurizoncapital.com.



2.4. CDP

Since 2004, the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR S.p.A. has adhered to CDP, the independent

non-profit organization that offers companies, states, regions and cities a framework for measuring,

detecting, managing and sharing information on a global level regarding its environmental impact, with

the aim of promoting actions aimed at mitigating climate change.



2.5. NET ZERO ASSET MANAGERS INITIATIVE

The fiduciary duty with Clients and Investors and, more generally, with Stakeholders, requires the

Company to effectively manage sustainability-related issues and, specifically, climate change mitigation

and adaptation topics.

On 1 November 2021, the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR S.p.A. therefore adhered to the "Net

Zero Asset Managers Initiative" (also referred to as "NZAMI"), the international initiative promoted by

asset management companies committed to supporting the goal of achieving the neutrality of net

greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (so-called "Net Zero"), in line with the commitments made by the

States that signed the Paris Agreement, aiming at containing the impacts of climate change and limiting

the rise in temperatures by 1.5°C by 2050.

NZAMI is realised in the commitment to ensure transparency and accuracy also in achieving the

intermediate objective of aligning a portion of assets under management with the “Net Zero” scenario

already by 2030.

In this regard, NZAMI provides for:

− an average reduction of carbon emissions (CO2) of at least 50% compared to the year 2019 (this goal

is in fact recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a necessary

condition to mitigate the rise in temperatures by 1.5°C by 2050);

− the promotion of proactive engagement with less advanced issuers (“laggards") and sectors with

greater impact ("high impact");

− the transparency on the commitments undertaken within twelve months from the date of accession,

with the commitment (i) to implement an annual report that integrates the disclosure required by UN

PRI and (ii) to review the intermediate objectives at least every five years.

Participation in NZAMI also takes the form of the positive management of the Company's resources, for

example by monitoring the carbon footprint of its own activities (e.g., energy consumption and sources).



2.6. INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS GROUP ON CLIMATE CHANGE

For the purpose of a more effective implementation of the obligations deriving from the subscription of

the "Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative", starting from November 2021, the Parent Company Eurizon

Capital SGR S.p.A: joined the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), the European

association of investors that promotes collaboration on climate change and the reduction of net

greenhouse gas emissions. In this regard, the Company adopts the methodological framework developed

by IIGCC, called “Net Zero Investment Framework 1.5°C”, and a direct engagement approach with other

participating asset management companies.

finance" 8 (the "Forum"), the non-profit organization which involves financial operators and other

organizations interested in the environmental and social impact of investments. The Forum promotes the

knowledge and practice of sustainable investment, with the aim of spreading the integration of

environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) criteria into financial products and processes.



2.8. INTERNATIONAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE NETWORK

Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) - the international association promoting global standards of

corporate governance and engagement with investee issuers, with the aim of creating long-term value,

contributing to the sustainability of economies, society and the environment.



2.9. NATURE ACTION 100

Since August 2023, the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR S.p.A. has been part of the collective

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 10 of 29



− explain the procedures for including sustainability risks in investment decisions, in compliance with

the transparency requirements in Article 69 of the SFDR Regulation;

− promote, environmental or social characteristics among others, or a combination of those

characteristics, provided that the companies in which the investments are made follow good

governance practices, pursuant to Article 810 of the SFDR Regulation;

− has sustainable investment goals pursuant to Article 911 of the SFDR Regulation.

Portfolio management mandates characterised by the presence of specific indications in their respective

investment policies do not fall within the scope of application, considering the lower degree of discretion

in the selection of financial instruments.



5. SUSTAINABILITY RISK INTEGRATION PROCESS INTO THE INVESTMENT PROCESS OF ASSET UNDER

MANAGEMENT

In line with the obligations envisaged in EU regulations on the sustainability-related disclosure in the

financial services sector, the Company has defined specific methodologies to select and monitor financial

instruments aimed at integrating sustainability risks in the Managed Assets Investment Process.

These methodologies are appropriately defined based on the characteristics of the products and their

classification pursuant to the SFDR Regulation.

In particular, the products managed by the Company adopt the following “Macro Strategies” of:

NEGATIVE SCREENING, which provides for the adoption of limitations on issuers most exposed to

sustainability risks, with the aim of avoiding investments in financial instruments most exposed to the risk

of a loss in value due to the effect of an environmental, social or corporate governance event or condition.

By way of example, any violation of the principles related to the respect for human rights, such as

controversies concerning occupational health and safety, could affect the value of issuers due, for

instance, to legal actions and the related impacts on reputation. In addition, investments in issuers

belonging to sectors that rely on the production of energy from sources such as coal, could result in a

loss of value of the company over the medium/long term in the absence of credible transition strategies.

For this purpose, the Company has defined specific exclusions or restrictions, with their application

differentiated based on the type of financial product, aimed at mitigating problems related to the

sustainability of:

- CORPORATE ISSUERS, based on (i) potential adverse impacts on sustainability attributable to the

issuer’s sector of operations (for example, if belonging to sectors considered “not responsible”)

and/or to the company’s conduct in terms of adverse impacts on the environment and the

company (“PAI Binding screening”) and/or (ii) the presence of any additional critical

environmental, social and/or corporate governance factors, identified based on specific risk

indicators (“ESG Binding screening”);



9 Participants in financial markets shall include the description given below in pre-contractual information:

a) how sustainability risks are integrated in their investment decisions; and

b) the results of the assessment on the probable impacts of sustainability risks on the return of the financial products they

make available.

10 If a financial product promotes, among others, environmental or social characteristics, or a combination of those

characteristics, provided that the companies in which the investments are made follow good governance practices, the

information to disclose [omission], shall include the following:

a) information on how such characteristics are met;

b) if an index has been designated as a reference benchmark, information on whether and how this index

is consistent with those characteristics.

11 Where a financial product has sustainable investment as its objective and an index has been designated as a reference

benchmark, the information to be disclosed [omission] shall be accompanied by the following:

a) information on how the designated index is aligned with that objective;

b) an explanation as to why and how the designated index aligned with that objective differs from a broad market index.

2\. Where a financial product has sustainable investment as its objective and no index has been designated as a reference

benchmark, the information to be disclosed [omission] shall include an explanation on how that objective is to be attained.

3\. Where a financial product has a reduction in carbon emissions as its objective, the information to be disclosed [omission]

shall include the objective of low carbon emission exposure in view of achieving the long-term global warming objectives

of the Paris Agreement.

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 11 of 29



- GOVERNMENT ISSUERS, taking into account environmental and/or social problems, measured

based on the (i) levels of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions of the respective national economy

referred to scope 1, 2 and 3, weighted in relation to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), taking

account of the different purchasing power of countries (“Purchasing power parity-adjusted”) and

(ii) the inclusion of the Country among those considered to be “high risk” (“black list”) by the

Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) considering the inefficiencies in safeguards to combat

money laundering, terrorist financing and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (“ESG

Sovereign screening”);

POSITIVE SCREENING, which provides for, while respecting good governance practices, (i) the integration

of ESG factors in the analysis, selection and composition of managed portfolios (“ESG Integration”), or

(i) the achievement of sustainable investment goals (“Sustainable Investments”); for example, the

promotion of social and environmental characteristics by a mutual fund may be pursued by selecting the

instruments issued by companies whose production activities contribute to achieving the sustainable

development goals promoted by the United Nations;

STEWARDSHIP, through proactive interaction with issuers, by exercising participation and voting rights,

and engagement, encouraging effective communication with the relevant corporate bodies and/or top

management and relative representatives (“Active ownership – engagement”). For example, the

Company assesses whether to begin the engagement with companies belonging to sectors whose

activities have a significant impact on the biodiversity of areas in which they operate, to gain further

insights into the mitigation strategies taken and to monitor the progress towards declared commitments,

including initiatives to hinder deforestation.

In any case, additional restrictions for products that use ESG terms in their name, in compliance with

ESMA guidelines on funds’ names using ESG or sustainability-related terms of 21 August 2024, are not

affected.

The monitoring of sustainable and responsible investment topics relating to issuers present in the

managed products consists of the following stages:

− Analysis of investments (Screening), aimed at (i) identifying issuers considered most exposed to

sustainability risks, (ii) the integration of ESG factors in the analysis, selection and composition of

managed assets or (iii) the achievement of sustainable investment goals; the analysis uses data made

available by the specialised info-provider “MSCI ESG Research”, and additional public databases. The

info-providers used by the Company to support monitoring activities are approved by the Board of

Directors on the proposal of the Conducting Officers. In the case of issuers not covered by the

providers used by the Company or if there are interpretative doubts related to the quality of the data

acquired from the external databases, the Company avails of the assessments of the ESG \& Strategic

Activism Structure, supported by the LTSS Structure, which will subsequently be submitted to the first

available ESG Committee of the Parent Company and consequently in occasion of the next following

Company’s Risk Management Committee;

− Dissemination of data, in order to share the data and information resulting from the process of

investment universe analysis with competent company structures. The update process takes place at

least (i) monthly, for corporate issuers and (ii) annually, for government issuers. The list is effective

from the fifth working day following its publication on the Intranet and reviewed in occasion of the next

following Company’s Risk Management Committee, which may submit amendment proposals to the

competent functions of the Asset Management Division if deemed appropriate;

− Monitoring of investments, referred to the control of managed assets to assess the consistency of

collective asset management products and/or portfolio management in relation to the internal

methodologies aimed at (i) limiting sustainability risks and activating - where appropriate –

engagement initiatives with issuers, (ii) the integration of ESG factors in the analysis, selection and

composition of managed assets or (iii) the achievement of sustainable investment goals. Compliance

with internal limits is monitored by the Risk Management Function with the support of the Compliance

\& AML Function12. The limits set out in this Policy cannot be exceeded and accordingly there is no

authorisation process. The restrictions do not apply in the case of specific instructions issued by clients

within the portfolio management service;

− Periodic reporting to the Head of Investment , the Risk Committee and the Board of Directors; in this

regard, the ESG \& Strategic Activism Structure prepares quarterly reports that summarise the results

of the monitoring of managed assets, giving evidence to issuers for whom the (i) engagement process

has been activated and any initiatives undertaken and (ii) subject to prior clearance of the Company’s

Risk Committee, the Head of Investments of the Company may invite the Parent Company to waive

those restrictions by submitting a specific Investment Case to the ESG Committee outlining the

reasons, aimed at maintaining the positions, also to monitor their periodic update. Any deviation from

internal operating limits is also reported to the Risk Committee, as well as to the Board of Directors,

by the Risk Management Function.



The next Sections describe the individual Strategies for the integration of sustainability risks implemented

by the managed assets of the Company.



5.1. NEGATIVE SCREENING

The Company has adopted appropriate mechanisms to mitigate the sustainability risks of issuers, through

specific exclusions or restrictions appropriately differentiated based on (i) the management style, making

a distinction between actively managed products and index-linked products or products characterised by

a limited deviation from the reference benchmark (“Limited Tracking Error”) and (ii) the type of issuer, i.e.

corporate or government.



5.1.1. CORPORATE ISSUERS

As regards corporate issuers, the Company has defined the following limitations based on:

− the POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS ON SUSTAINABILITY (“PAI Binding screening”)

− the PRESENCE OF CRITICAL ASPECTS in environmental, social and/or corporate governance terms (“ESG

Binding screening”)



ISSUERS IDENTIFIED BASED ON THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS ON SUSTAINABILITY (“PAI BINDING

SCREENING”)

Although the effects of investment decisions on sustainability factors should be considered according to

the different range of activities, geographic areas and sectors to which the managed products are

exposed, the Company believes that adequate monitoring of exposure to social and environmental issues

is a priority to mitigate the sustainability risk of its investments, as well as the related adverse impacts on

the environment and/or the company.

For these reasons, the assessment of the principal adverse impacts related to issuers represents a

significant aspect of the managed assets Investment Process, to implement a structured process of risk

control and performance measurement, with the aim of maintaining a correct balance of the risk/return

profile of the financial products offered to clients.

To mitigate sustainability risks, the Company has defined specific limitations related to the following

adverse impact indicators with the aim of identifying issuers belonging to sectors considered “not

responsible” and/or whose conduct is such as to have significant, negative repercussions on the

environment and/or in the social dimension:



involvement in the manufacture of unconventional weapons, therefore the exclusions contemplated in Law no. 220/2021

apply; the exclusions for active management products also apply to Limited Tracking Errors that specifically integrate ESG

factors in own investment choices.

On this basis, the Company considers issuers operating in the following sectors (PAI 4) as “not

responsible” from an environmental perspective:

− THERMAL COAL, i.e. issuers involved in extraction or electricity production activities linked to thermal

coal, which is the most significant fossil fuel for carbon dioxide emissions.

Issuers are identified as those that derive, from these activities, (i) at least 25% of revenue or (ii) 20%

of revenue, in the presence of expansion plans.

− EXPLOITATION OF OIL SANDS, i.e. issuers involved in the extraction of oil and gas, through the

exploitation of oil sands.

These issuers are identified as those that derive at least 10% of revenue from these activities.

The above criteria do not refer to issues of green bonds or sustainability bonds.

As regards issuers with exposure below the thresholds identified by the Company (“below-threshold

issuers”), the ESG \& Strategic Activism Structure carries out specific engagement activities. The purpose

of these activities, carried out according to the procedures outlined in the “Engagement policy of Eurizon

Capital SGR S.p.A.”, is to ensure that no new thermal coal generation or oil sands extraction projects are

developed, and to verify the phase out of such activities.

In addition, the Company considers as “not responsible” from a social point of view, those issuers that

operate in the sector of UNCONVENTIONAL WEAPONS (PAI 14), i.e. issuers characterised by an evident

direct involvement in the manufacture of the following types of weapons13: Landmines; Cluster bombs;



13 The above provisions do not apply to activities that are permitted under the following treaties and/or conventions:

− the Ottawa Treaty (1997) which prohibits the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines;

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 14 of 29



Nuclear weapons14, Impoverished uranium, Biological weapons, Chemical weapons, Non-detectable

fragment weapons, Blinding lasers, Incendiary weapons, White Phosphorous.



The purpose of these safeguards is also to comply with the requirements of Law 220 of 9 December 2021

on measures to combat the financing of firms manufacturing landmines, and cluster munitions and sub-

munitions and with the relative Instructions of 26 July 2024 of the Bank of Italy, COVIP, IVASS and MEF

on the exercise of enhanced controls on the work of authorised intermediaries.

As regards the other adverse impact indicators, the Company has set out specific analysis processes

and thresholds to assess the performance of issuers to be subject to restrictions and/or exclusions based

on the presence of significant negative environmental and/or social externalities:

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 15 of 29



ISSUERS CHARACTERISED BY CRITICAL ASPECTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND/OR CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE MATTERS (“ESG BINDING SCREENING”)

The Company has set up a safeguard system for issuers with a critical ESG profile, i.e. with an ESG

rating equal to “CCC” - the lowest in the investment universe - by “MSCI ESG Research”16.

For these issuers, the ESG \& Strategic Activism Structure carries out an in-depth analysis, also based

on the significance of these issuers in the main benchmarks, and referring - among others - to the “ESG

Risk Score” assigned to the issuer by the LTSS Structure. In this regard, the Company considers issuers

with an “ESG Risk Score” below 417.

The results of the due diligence process are presented to the first available ESG Committee of the Parent

Company Eurizon Capital SGR S.p.A., that decides on the approval of the “critical” issuers list and the

activation of the related investment limits. The results are consequently shared with the Head of

Investments and at the Company’s first Risk Committee.

For “critical” issuers, the Company has established specific escalation processes.



5.1.2. GOVERNMENT ISSUERS

ISSUERS IDENTIFIED BASED ON THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS ON SUSTAINABILITY (“ESG SOVEREIGN

SCREENING”)

The Company has defined an annual monitoring process to identify Countries most exposed to

sustainability risks by analysing the following indicators:

− GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION INTENSITY (PAI 15) referred to scope 1, 2 and 3 of the respective national

economy, weighted in relation to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) taking into account the different

purchasing power of Countries (“Purchasing power parity-adjusted”), above 850 tons of CO2

equivalent per million Euro of GDP;

− The FATF BLACK LIST, i.e. the list of Countries considered to be at high risk by the “Financial Action

Task Force” (FATF), in view of deficiencies in the safeguards for combating money laundering, terrorist

financing and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

The financial instruments issued by international public bodies of one or more States (supranational

issuers) are subject to a specific assessment process overseen by the ESG \& Strategic Activism

Structure, with the results notified to the ESG Committee of the Parent Company. The results are

consequently shared with the Head of Investments and at the Company’s first Risk Committee.



5.2. POSITIVE SCREENING

The next Sections describe the different procedures to integrate ESG factors in the processes to analyse

and select financial instruments implemented by the products managed by the Company in order to (i)

promote, among others, environmental or social characteristics, or a combination of those, pursuant to

Article 8 of the SFDR (“ESG Integration”) or (ii) the achievement of sustainable investment targets,

pursuant to Article 9 of the same Regulation (“Sustainable Investments”).

The products may implement up to two of the aforesaid strategies, based on their significance in relation

to the management style and/or asset classes selected by the Investment Structure in charge of

implementing the investment policy. If the product entails the use of more than one strategy, the controls

are performed on respective portions of the portfolio.

Moreover, the products classified pursuant to Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR invest in corporate issuers

that comply with good governance practices.



16 The info-provider “MSCI ESG Research” provides ESG ratings for issuers on a scale with 7 levels (AAA, AA, A, BBB,

BB, B, and CCC). These ratings are calculated based on a qualitative and quantitative process that assesses specific KPIs

attributable to Environmental, Social and Governance aspects. The three pillars have different weightings according to the

issuer's industry sector.

17 Proprietary Score that integrates environmental, social and governance factors through a structured assessment system,

expressed on a scale from 0 to 10, which is differentiated for corporate and government issuers.

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 16 of 29



5.2.1. ESG INTEGRATION

INVESTMENTS BASED ON POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CRITERIA (“THEMATIC INTEGRATION”)

In the case of ethical and thematic products, the Company has defined processes for selecting

investments based on specific positive and negative criteria contemplated in the offering documentation.

In particular, the investment universe available to fund managers consists of the issuers:

- Included in the benchmarks of the ethical funds and thematic products;

- whose compatibility with the criteria established in the offering documentation has been verified.



INVESTMENTS BASED ON SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT CRITERIA (“SUSTAINABLE INTEGRATION”)

The managed products may promote, among others, environmental or social characteristics, or their

combination, pursuing the goal of building portfolios characterised by an exposure, in line with the

provisions of the offering documentation, in sustainable investments pursuant to the SFDR Regulation.

This objective is achieved by investing a portion of the portfolio18, the extent of which is defined based on

the asset classes and geographic allocation of each product and is at least equal to 10% in financial

instruments of sustainable issuers. Sustainable issuers are those issuers whose activities contribute to

one or more sustainable development goals, i.e. the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) promoted

by the United Nations, on condition that (i) these investments do not significantly harm any of the

environmental or social goals outlined in the SFDR Regulation and that (ii) the companies benefiting from

such investments comply with good governance practices. To identify sustainable investments pursuant

to the SFDR Regulation, please refer to the Section “Methodology for identifying sustainable investments”

of this document.



INVESTMENTS BASED ON TARGET UCI SCREENING (“MANAGER SELECTION INTEGRATION”)

In the case of products with an investment policy that may be pursued through investment in parts of

target UCIs up to 100% of the assets, these UCIs are selected by those managed (i) by the Company

and other Companies of the Group (“related UCIs”), and (ii) by primary asset management companies,

based on the quality and consistency of results, as well as the robustness of the related ESG and/or SRI

investment process.

These products envisage investing at least 70% of the assets in units of target UCIs that pursue, in

respective investment policies:

− the promotion, among others, of environmental or social characteristics, or a combination of those

characteristics, as well as the respect of good governance practices, pursuant to Article 8 of the SFDR

Regulation;

− sustainable investment goals, pursuant to Article 9 of the SFDR Regulation.



INVESTMENTS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CONSTRUCTION LOGICS OF BENCHMARKS OR SELECTED

FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (“INDEX/DERIVATIVE INTEGRATION”)

As regards products that have investment policies which take into account the construction logics of their

own benchmarks - such as index-linked products or products with a Limited Tracking Error - or that

implement strategies involving the replication of one or more financial indices (“Index/Derivative

Integration”), the Company integrates ESG criteria respectively through:

− the selection of benchmarks that consider environmental and/or social factors and respect good

governance practices consistent with the provisions of the SFDR Regulation;

− the use of financial derivative instruments that consider environmental and/or social factors and

respect good governance practices consistent with the product investment policy.

In such cases, the process to integrate ESG factors requires products to invest, also through financial

derivative instruments, at least 90% of assets in issuers present in the benchmark (“ESG Index

Integration”).

Alternatively, where managed products promote environmental and/or social characteristics through the

use of financial derivative instruments consistent with the provisions in their own offering documentation,



18 This condition applies to products that pursue “Sustainable Integration” as the only strategy to integrate sustainability

risks.

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 17 of 29



the latter are characterised by indices whose construction methodologies consider environmental and/or

social factors. In these cases, according to the process to integrate ESG factors, products must invest at

least 90% of the strategy (shares and/or bonds) in financial derivative instruments that allow for an

exposure, also through indices, to issuers selected based on environmental and/or social factors (“ESG

Derivative Integration”).



INVESTMENTS IN GOVERNMENT ISSUERS (“SOVEREIGN INTEGRATION”)

The managed products may promote, among others, environmental or social characteristics, or their

combination, pursuing the goal of building portfolios characterised by an exposure, in line with the

provisions of the offering documentation, in government, supranational or agency issuers.

This objective is achieved by investing in the assets of government, supranational or agency financial

instruments that pass an internal methodology (“Sovereign Sustainability Ambition (SSA) Framework”)

involving the analysis of sustainability factors and the in-depth assessment of the characteristics of each

Country in order to define the investment universe of products that invest in government, agency or

supranational issuers pursuant to Article 8 of the SFDR Regulation.

This methodology allows to classify Countries into 4 Classes, of which:

− no. 3 classes are eligible for investment, appropriately graded based on the quality of safeguards,

namely: “Achieving Countries”, “Improving Countries” and “Conservative Countries”;

− no. 1 identifies Countries that are not eligible for investment, i.e. Countries that do not pass the

selection process in Section 5.1.2. “Government issuers”.

On this basis, the methodology defined by the Company considers the following no. 7 indicators:

− the “SDG Index Score”, which measures the positioning of each Country in relation to the 17 SDGs,

on a scale from 0 (worst score) to 100 (full achievement of the objective);

− the “International Spillover Score”, which measures the adverse socioeconomic and environmental

impacts generated by individual Countries abroad, on a scale from 0 (worst score) to 100 (best score);

− the “GHG intensity PPP - Adjusted” (“Carbon Footprint”), which measures the intensity of greenhouse

gas emissions produced by individual Countries by million Euro of Gross Domestic Product (GDP),

taking into account the different purchasing power (“Purchase Power Parity” or “PPP”);

− the presence of “social violations” in relation to international conventions and treaties, the principles

of the United Nations and, as applicable, national regulations;

− the Country is on the list of non-cooperative jurisdictions from a fiscal point of view;

− the Country is on FATF lists relative to (i) high-risk Countries (“black list”) or (ii) Countries subject to

significant monitoring (“grey list”) due to deficiencies in systems for combating money laundering,

terrorist financing and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction;

− the “Corruption Index”, which assesses the perceived level of corruption of the public sector of each

Country on a scale from 0 (worst score) to 100 (best score).

Based on the screening carried out, the Countries are divided into no. 4 Classes based on the intensity

of the safeguards.

The green, social or sustainability bonds issued by the individual Countries are classified in the category

“Achieving Countries”, regardless of the Class the Country belongs to.

The financial instruments issued by international public bodies of one or more States (“supranational

issuers”), are subject to a specific assessment process overseen with the support of ESG \& Strategic

Activism Structure, the results are notified to the ESG Committee of the Parent Company in order to

assign the reference Class and consequently shared with the Head of Investments and at the Company's

first Risk Committee.

The financial instruments issued by government agencies are instead assigned to the Class the reference

Country belongs to.

The exposure of products to the different Classes of Countries is differentiated, providing for minimum

and/or maximum limits, based on respective investment policies, making a distinction between products

that invest:

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 18 of 29



− mainly in government issuers;

− in several asset classes (“mixed” products);

− in certain geographic areas of reference (emerging or developed Countries).



INVESTMENTS BASED ON THE CARBON FOOTPRINT (“CARBON FOOTPRINT”)

Products that integrate assessments related to the measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions

generated by issuers into their portfolio construction process aim to achieve a lower ecological footprint

than:

− the reference benchmark, for managed products characterised by the presence of a benchmark;

− the investment universe, for products whose investment policy does not include a benchmark.

With the aim of monitoring the significance of data on the CO2 emissions of individual portfolios, the

Company monitors issuers without an ecological footprint to ensure they do not exceed 20% of the net

assets of the individual managed product.



INVESTMENTS BASED ON THE AVERAGE “ESG SCORE” OF THE PORTFOLIO (“ESG SCORE INTEGRATION”)

In line with the provisions of the respective offering documentation, the managed products may promote,

among others, environmental or social characteristics, or their combination, pursuing the goal of

constructing portfolios characterised by an "ESG score" which is better than that of:

− the reference benchmark, for managed products characterised by the presence of one benchmark;

− the investment universe, for products whose investment policy does not include a benchmark.

For certain products, depending on the peculiarities of the investment strategies implemented (e.g.

protected UCITS), investment universes may be identified that are representative of the different

components of the portfolio (e.g. equity exposure and bond exposure).

With the aim of monitoring the significance of data relative to individual portfolios, the Company monitors

issuers without an ESG score to ensure they do not exceed 20% of the net assets of the individual

managed product.

For UCIs whose offering documentation complies with the Recommendation of the Autorité des Marchés

Financiers (AMF) of March 11, 2020 on "Information to be provided by Collective Investment Schemes

incorporating non-financial approaches", the Company monitors the materiality of the data in compliance

with indications of the French Supervisory Authorities.



INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (“SECURITIZED INTEGRATION”)

The managed products may promote, among others, environmental or social characteristics, or their

combination, pursuing the goal of constructing portfolios characterised by an exposure, in line with the

provisions of the offering documentation, in securitized financial instruments.

This objective is achieved by investing at least 70% of assets in securitized financial instruments that

pass an internal analysis process defined by the Structured Products team - coordinating with the ESG

\& Strategic Activism Structure - based on the frameworks available in the literature and market best

practices.

The internal process comprises the following no. 3 stages:

− pre-screening, involving the adoption of preventive exclusion principles (i) of the transaction

counterparty and (ii) the type of asset;

− due diligence, which assesses the promotion of environmental or social characteristics as an

investment opportunity, based on qualitative/quantitative information analysed on 3 dimensions: (i) the

Counterparty, (ii) the Transaction \& Asset and (iii) the reference Country of the transaction;

− engagement, for transactions with a higher level of exposure to ESG risks.



5.2.2. SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT GOALS (“SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS”)

The next Sections describe the procedures adopted by products managed by the Company, in order to

pursue sustainable investment goals pursuant to the SFDR Regulation, while respecting good

governance practices: (i) SDG Investing and (ii) Impact Investing.

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 19 of 29



INVESTMENTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (“SDG INVESTING”)

Managed products may pursue sustainable development goals, selecting financial instruments such as

shares, bonds and/or target UCIs that contribute to one or more environmental and/or social goals, on

condition that these investments do not significantly harm any of the environmental or social goals

outlined in the SFDR Regulation and that the companies benefiting from such investments respect good

governance practices.

The product may also be invested in liquidity management instruments, as well as financial derivative

instruments used for risk hedging and for efficient portfolio management, in line with the investment policy

and sustainable investment policy provided for by the product investment policy.

To identify sustainable investments pursuant to the SFDR Regulation, please refer to the Section

“Methodology for identifying sustainable investments” of this document.



IMPACT INVESTING

Products that promote sustainable investment goals, subject to compliance with good governance

practices by the investee issuers, implement investment selection methodologies aimed at generating a

measurable and positive social or environmental impact in addition to a financial return. This category of

products includes those that mainly invest in green bonds or in similar financial instruments, such as

social bonds and sustainability bonds.

The due diligence process is aligned with the “Green Bond Principles” (GBP), the “Social Bond Principles”

(SBP) and the “Sustainability Bond Guidelines” (SBG) defined by the International Capital Market

Association (ICMA) and the EU Green Bond Standard (GBS). The analysis process involves (i) an

objective analysis of the purposes of the financed projects and (ii) a subjective assessment of the project

management methods, the organizational structure of the issuer, the environmental footprint, with

particular attention to the level of transparency and the quality of reporting.



5.3. STEWARDSHIP

To steer the conduct adopted by the Company to encourage engagement with the issuers it invests in,

integrating its own commitment as shareholder to the investment strategy, the Company has adopted the

“Engagement Policy of Eurizon Capital SA”, which describes the organisational and/or procedural

measures that govern the participation in Shareholder Meetings and the engagement with companies

deemed “relevant”.



5.4. MONITORING OF GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

The products classified pursuant to Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR Regulation invest in companies that

respect good governance practices pursuant to the SFDR Regulation, i.e., companies that:

(i) have solid management structures, i.e., with independent members on their administrative body, that

have not received negative opinions from external auditors and have no controversies in relation to

Principle no. 10 of the United Nations Global Compact, related to the commitment against corruption

in all its forms;

(ii) regarding personnel relations, have no controversies in relation to Principle no. 3 of UNGC, related

to the freedom of association and recognition of the right to collective bargaining;

(iii) regarding personnel remuneration, have no controversies in relation to Principle no. 6 of UNGC,

related to the freedom of association and recognition of the right to collective bargaining;

(iv) have no controversies regarding tax obligations, i.e., tax proceedings against the company not yet

resolved.

This definition does not include government issuers19.



19 See the Q\&As published by the European Commission on 17 May 2022, “Questions related to Regulation (EU)

2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability related disclosures in

the financial services sector (SFDR)”.

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 20 of 29



In this regard, the Company has defined specific monitoring criteria, which are differentiated between (i)

listed issuers and (ii) unlisted companies that use 6 indicators which consider the aspects contained in

the definition included in the SFDR Regulation.

7. PROCESS FOR SCREENING THE ASSETS SELECTED FROM MANAGED FUNDS

7.1. TARGET UCIS

The Company invests in target UCIs of third-party fund Management Company provided they are included

in the UCI buy-list transmitted by the competent functions of the Asset Management Division.

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 21 of 29



As part of the process of selecting and monitoring the target UCIs of third-party fund Management

Company (mutual investment funds and SICAVs), the Multimanager Investments Structure of the

Investment Department of the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR S.p.A. assesses - in addition to

economic and financial analyses the level of integration of SRI and/or ESG factors and related

sustainability risks, in the framework of:

− the investment decision-making processes of Management Company, in accordance with Article 6 of

the SFDR;

− the investment policy of each UCI, monitoring:

− compliance with the requirements of Italian Law 220 of 9 December 2021 (and related Instructions of

the Bank of Italy, COVIP, IVASS and MEF) on the exercise of enhanced controls on the work of

authorised intermediaries to combat the financing of firms manufacturing anti-personnel land mines,

and cluster munitions and sub-munitions;

− the promotion, among other characteristics, of environmental or social characteristics, or a

combination of those characteristics, as well as compliance with good governance practices, pursuant

to Article 8 of SFDR;

− the adoption of sustainable investment objectives, pursuant to Article 9 of the SFDR;

− as well as the presence of any additional ESG-type distinctive elements in the management of each

product.

This information - acquired directly from Management Company and / or through specialized info-

providers (e.g. Bloomberg, Morningstar) - is assessed as one of the elements considered for possible

approval in the UCI buy-list, and as a possible choice criterion, among others, by the portfolio managers

of the Company. As part of its own due diligence activities, the Multimanager Investments Structure of

the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR S.p.A. gives preference to the Management Company that

provide a high level of transparency on the products they manage, including about how they integrate

sustainability risks and integrate environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors and

sustainable and responsible investment (SRI) principles within their respective investment processes.

In this context, the Risk Management Function, on the basis of the offer documentation and any further

documentation obtained from the Management Company, the results of the analyses relating to the level

of integration of SRI and/or ESG factors and the related sustainability risks.

The above-described screening process is disapplied in case of specific UCI buy-list approved by the

competent bodies of investment funds belonging to Fund Hosting service line20 or in case of specific

instruction from customer as part of the Discretionary Portfolio Management activity.



8. METHODOLOGY TO IDENTIFY SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS

The following paragraphs describe the methodology adopted by the Company in order toto identify

sustainable investments according to the SFDR Regulation, with particular reference to (i) issuers of

equity and/or bond financial instruments and (ii) target UCITS.

8.1. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS – SHARES AND/OR BONDS

The model defined by the Investment Department's ESG \& Strategic Activism and LTSS departments

involves assessing issuers on the basis of an internal methodology that uses data made available by the

specialist info-provider "MSCI ESG Research" and which measure the degree of alignment of an issuer

with the 17 SDGs promoted by the United Nations.

The methodology defined by the ESG \& Strategic Activism Structure covers aspects contained in the

definition given in the SFDR Regulation, using the data made available by the specialised info-provider

“MSCI ESG Research”.

In particular, the internal process considers the following safeguards:

− COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES;



20 With the exception of issuers that have a direct involvement in the manufacture of unconventional weapons.

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 22 of 29



− POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO AN ENVIRONMENTAL OR SOCIAL GOAL;

− RESPECT OF THE PRINCIPLE "DO NO SIGNIFICANT HARM” (“DNSH”).

To classify an issuer as sustainable, the Company assesses the following indicators:



ANALYSIS DIMENSION INDICATOR DESCRIPTION OF THE CRITERION



GOOD GOVERNANCE NO. 6 INDICATORS



− Structure of the administrative body;

− External auditor;

− Absence of controversies in relation to Principle no. 10 of the

United Nations Global Compact;

− Absence of controversies in relation to Principle no. 3 of the United

Nations Global Compact;

− Absence of controversies in relation to Principle no. 6 of the United

Nations Global Compact;

− Absence of controversies relating to tax obligations.



POSITIVE SCREENING



ALIGNMENT WITH THE SDGS − The issuer has at least no. 1 SDG with a score equal to “Aligned” or

“Strongly Aligned”.



ALIGNMENT WITH THE TAXONOMY

The issuer has a percentage:

− of revenue in taxonomy-aligned activities;

− of capital expenditure (capex) in taxonomy-aligned activities.

PRESENCE OF DECARBONISATION

TARGETS

The issuer has a target validated by the Science Based Target

Initiative.



DO NO SIGNIFICANT HARM

(“DNSH") PAI INDICATORS The issuer complies with the thresholds defined for the principal

adverse impacts of investment decisions on sustainability (“PAI”).



ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS



MISALIGNMENT WITH THE SDGS No misalignment with one or more SDGs.



CULTIVATION AND/OR

PROCESSING OF TOBACCO

The issuer does not operate in the sector of the cultivation and/or

processing of tobacco.



MINIMUM TRANSPARENCY

REQUIREMENTS



The issuer provides information on:

− greenhouse gas emissions;

− the gender pay gap;

− gender diversity of the Board of Directors.



“CRITICAL” ISSUER The issuer does not have a higher exposure to environmental, social

and corporate governance risks.

Target companies are therefore considered as “sustainable issuers” if they comply with:

− good governance practices;

− at least one criterion of making a positive contribution to environmental and/or social goals;

− the criteria contemplated for the DNSH principle and additional safeguards defined by the Company.

In any case, green bonds, social bonds, or sustainability bonds are considered to be sustainable.

For further details on the indicators used to identify sustainable issuers, please refer to Attachment 1

“Methodologies to select and monitor financial instruments aimed at integrating sustainability risks in the

managed assets investment process”.

8.2. TARGET UCIS

As regards target UCIs (mutual investment funds and SICAVs), the Company has defined an assessment

methodology which aims to estimate the part of the product invested in sustainable issuers. For this

purpose, as regards the UCIs that promote, among others, environmental or social characteristics, or

their combination, or that have a sustainable development goal pursuant to Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR

Regulation, the Company considers the minimum exposure declared in the offering documentation for (i)

products managed by the Company or its subsidiaries (related UCIs), as well as (ii) products established

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 23 of 29



by third-party fund houses, while maintaining due diligence activities as indicated in the Section “Process

for screening the assets selected by managed funds” of this document.



9. MANAGEMENT MANDATES TO THIRD-PARTY MANAGEMENT COMPANIES

If the financial management of one or more products is delegated to a third-party fund house with respect

to the Asset Management Division, the Company verifies, based on the initial and periodic due diligence

process overseen by the competent structures of the Company, that the third-party Managers adopt

policies compliant with the requirements of applicable regulations on sustainability risk management.

In particular, according to the objectives pursued and the relative categorisation of each product pursuant

to the SFDR Regulation, the Company reserves the right to examine the following documents, aimed at

(i) investigating the procedures defined by the delegated Managers for the adoption of effective

safeguards aimed at integrating sustainability risks into its Investment Process and (ii) ensuring that the

delegated manager is aligned with the principles adopted by the Company through this Policy:

− Sustainability policy defined at the Management Company level (documents relating to sustainable

initiatives and the commitment of the Manager);

− Investment management policy (processes and procedures adopted for managing the sustainability

risk, exclusion policies, etc.) defined for the individual managed portfolio, if available;

− Monitoring report (using the following KPIs: trend of the metrics used to measure sustainability risk,

reports of violations of sustainability policies in the event of investments in controversial issuers,

monitoring of the controversies management process and of the corrective actions defined, etc.).

As an internal policy, the Company does not delegate the exercise of voting rights to the delegated

investment managers and therefore adopts the “Strategy for exercising participating and voting rights

concerning the financial instruments of assets managed by Eurizon Capital S.A.” also with reference to

the latter products.

The macro-strategies or “negative screening” defined in the section “Process to integrate sustainability

risks in the Managed Assets Investment Process“ are also applicable to delegated Managers. To this

end, the Compliance \& AML Function periodically monitors the positioning undertaken.

These restrictions can be waived only in the presence of specific investment instructions given by

customers as part of the Portfolio Management or Fund Hosting services21, if not conflicting with offering

documentation.



10. ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACTS OF SUSTAINABILITY RISKS ON THE RETURN OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS

Pursuant to Article 6 of the SFDR Regulation, the Company assesses the probable impacts of

sustainability risks on the return of financial products.

The Risk Management Function has therefore adopted a methodology that analyses sustainability risks

within the more general framework of the measurement and management of financial risks of managed

products.

The assessment of the probable impacts of sustainability risks on returns is determined based on the

following variables:

− the product sustainability risk, represented by the ESG rating, calculated based on data obtained from

the specialised info-provider “MSCI ESG Research”;

− the synthetic product risk indicator, in line with indications in the offering documentation.

Based on the combination of the values of the aforementioned 2 variables, a level of probable impact is

identified, classified using a 5-tier scale, from “low” to “high” according to an internal assessment

methodology. In fact, the probable impact of sustainability risks on financial returns is considered to be

“low” for products that have a low synthetic risk indicator and an ESG rating, positioned in the higher

brackets, and gradually increases based on the level of risk and/or in the presence of lower ESG ratings.



21 With the exception of issuers that have a direct involvement in the manufacture of unconventional weapons.

S.p.A.”



11. PRINCIPAL ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE SUSTAINABILITY OF INVESTMENT CHOICES

The next Sections describe the methodology adopted by the Company to identify the principal adverse

impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors.



11.1. TRANSPARENCY AT ENTITY LEVEL

Pursuant to the provisions in Article 4 of the SFDR Regulation, the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR

prepares an annual statement, approved by the Board of Directors and published on the website, which

(i) describes the strategies adopted to identify the principal adverse impacts of investment decisions on

sustainability factors and (ii) defines the related mitigation actions, identifying the priorities to be

addressed.



Considering that some areas are lagging behind in promoting the adoption of best sustainable

development standards and that some industrial sectors are structurally more exposed to risks and

benefit from fewer sustainable growth opportunities, the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR and the

related branches (hereinafter also “Eurizon”) believe that the assessments must take place considering

the geographic and/or sector context and the ability of businesses to implement sustainable development

strategies, to start a process of transition for their own business model or to seize opportunities for

development. Although many investments undertaken on behalf of financial products are able to generate

positive impacts on investees and relative stakeholders, the assets held by managed products may have

adverse impacts on the environment or people (“principal adverse impacts on the sustainability of

investments”).



In view of the wide range of activities, geographic areas and sectors in which the Asset Management

Division Companies invest on behalf of their products, the potential adverse impacts are not

homogeneous. However, Eurizon believes that adequate monitoring of exposure to social and

environmental issues is a priority to mitigate the potential adverse impacts of its investments. The

exposure of investees to sustainability risks may, in fact, cause direct or indirect effects on the financial

performance of investments, in addition to reputational and ethical risks. For this purpose, Eurizon gives

importance to (i) the respect of human rights and countering the production of unconventional weapons,

(ii) exposure to environmental issues, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, mitigation of

the loss of biodiversity and offsetting deforestation and (iii) good corporate governance practices.

Eurizon is therefore actively committed to mitigating the adverse impacts of investments through the

adoption of strategies which provide for (i) the negative screening of issuers, with the aim of mitigating

the risks of exposure to companies operating in sectors deemed “not responsible”, such as the fossil fuels

and unconventional weapons sectors, or which are characterised by critical environmental, social or

corporate governance issues; (ii) the positive integration of ESG factors in the analysis, selection and

composition of financial portfolios and the selection of sustainable investments pursuant to the SFDR

Regulation and (iii) engagement with investees through the exercise of voting rights and, if considered

appropriate, stewardship activities, in particular concerning environmental and social issues. To protect

its own investors and stakeholders, Eurizon has specific mechanisms in place (i) for a transparent

approach to the sustainability of investments, and (ii) for managing risks, to monitor an aware assumption

of investments choices by managed assets.

With reference to the principal adverse impacts of investment choices on sustainability factors, Eurizon

has defined specific safeguards for the identification, analysis and prioritisation of the adverse impacts of

investment choices on sustainability factors by identifying and monitoring them, using data obtained from

the specialist info-provider “MSCI ESG Research”.

In this context, the LTSS and ESG \& Strategic Activism Structures of the Investment Department and

Risk Management Function of the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR supervise the activities of

identification and prioritization of the principal adverse impacts of investment choices on sustainability

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 25 of 29



factors, through the monitoring of “Principal Adverse Impacts” 22 . The results of the analyses are

presented to the Risk Committee, which is responsible for defining appropriate actions to mitigate the

adverse impacts connected with sustainability risks and the priorities to adopt for the subsequent period.

In the best interest of its financial products, Eurizon is committed to:

7. continuing to develop its sustainability policies, with the aim of fostering the mitigation of the principal

adverse impacts on sustainability factors, also through the adoption of new negative and/or positive

screening strategies;

8. focussing its engagement actions with investee issuers with the aim of directing them towards the

improvement of their sustainability practices, evaluating, only as a last resort, the divestiture of their

investments. Eurizon also acknowledges that an effective management of principal adverse impacts

on the environment and society requires a collective effort and therefore endorses codes of

responsible business conduct and internationally recognised standards.



11.2. TRANSPARENCY AT A FINANCIAL PRODUCTS LEVEL

The assessment of the principal adverse impacts23 of investment choices on sustainability factors and

the definition of related mitigation actions are an integral part of the Company’s approach to sustainability.

In this regard, the Company has adopted an internal methodology (framework) that defines how the so-

called "Principal Adverse Impact indicators" ("PAIs") are taken into account within the managed assets,

pursuant to Article 7 of the SFDR Regulation.

This framework includes the use of specific indicators, as set out in Commission Delegated Regulation

(EU) 2022/128824, which are associated based on the characteristics and objectives of the individual

financial products based on the oversight already defined by the Company which includes the use of the

following mechanisms:

(i) Negative SRI and ESG screening, with the aim of mitigating sustainability risks and avoiding

investments in the financial instruments most exposed to the risk of a loss in value due to the effect

of an environmental, social or corporate governance type event or condition;

(ii) Positive screening of ESG factors in the analysis, selection and composition of financial portfolios

and the selection of sustainable investments pursuant to the SFDR Regulation;

(iii) Stewardship, through proactive interaction with investees, achieved through the exercise of

participation and voting rights and through the engagement with them.

To this end, for each of the above-mentioned mechanisms, the Company has identified the relative impact

indicators to make offering documentation transparent as regards the procedures adopted for considering

these indicators in relation to each asset managed.



12. INTEGRATION OF SUSTAINABILITY RISKS IN REMUNERATION AND INCENTIVE POLICIES

The Company's Remuneration and Incentive Policies take into consideration sustainability risks pursuant

to art. 525 of the SFDR Regulation.

In particular, the annual Incentive Systems provide for:

9. the attribution to Group Risk Takers, company Risk Takers and Middle Management who do not

belong to the chain of managers of a specific objective, among those of strategic action, linked to the



22 For any further information, please refer to the "Principal Adverse Impact Statement of Eurizon Capital SGR S.p.A. and

subsidiaries” available on the website.



24 The Commission Delegated Regulation indicates the content, methodologies and procedures for the presentation of

information required under Article 4 of the SFDR in relation to the principal adverse impacts at an entity level for

sustainability indicators (i) on the climate and other adverse impacts related to the environment and (ii) in the social

dimension and regarding employees, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and bribery.

25 Pursuant to Article 5 of the SFDR, "Financial market participants and financial advisors shall include in their remuneration policies

information on how such policies are consistent with the integration of sustainability risks and shall publish such information on their

websites."

Summary of the Sustainability Policy Page 26 of 29



initiatives of the Company that take into account environmental, social and governance factors (so-

called "Environmental, Social and Governance factors" - ESG);

10. corrective mechanism of the theoretical premium related to the portfolio managers connected to

the management of sustainability risks (so-called "sustainability corrective mechanism") which

provides for the comparison between the "sustainability rating" of the portfolios managed (i.e.

weighted average ESG score of the products referred to the individual manager) and the target

rating (i.e. average ESG score of the parameters associated with the product, i.e. the

benchmark or the investment universe) in accordance with the methods described in Paragraph

5.2.1 "ESG Integration".



13. POLICY REVIEW AND PUBLICITY

The Sustainability Policy of the Company is subject to annual review by the Compliance \& AML function

with the support of the ESG \& Strategic Activism Structure of the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR

S.p.A., to assess the consistency of the methodologies adopted by the Company with the evolution of

best practices developed at national and international level.

Before submission to the Board of Directors for final approval, any amendment to the Policy is brought to

the attention of the Product Development and Risk Committee of the Company.



14. REPORTING

and other stakeholders with a summary of this Policy, as well as any relevant amendment, if any, via its

website www.eurizoncapital.com.

In line with the timelines provided for by the SFDR Regulation, for products that:

11. promote, among other characteristics, environmental or social characteristics, or a combination
