Engagement policy Pagina 6 di 14

SCOPEThis Policy describes the procedures adopted by the Company in terms of engagement with the

That said, with reference to shares, the Company favours dialogue and participation in Shareholder meetings

of investees, based on a “targeted” approach to corporate governance, encouraging - by adopting the principle

of proportionality - companies deemed “relevant” according to the qualitative/quantitative criteria indicated from

time to time in internal regulations.

With regard to bond instruments, the Company acknowledges the role that stewardship activities may have,

not only prior to the investment, but throughout the duration of the instrument, in line with a long-term approach.

In this context, the Company analyses, among other characteristics, the issuer’s sustainability profile, the

capital structure, its composition and development over time.

The Company does not intend to "micro-manage" the investee issuers nor does it preclude any decision to

dispose of an interest, where this represents the most effective solution to protect the interests of Clients/

Investors.

With specific reference to the provision of the Portfolio Management Service for institutional clients, this policy

applies, in compliance with applicable regulations, based on written agreements (“management mandates”)

with each client.

PART II - ORGANISATIONAL SAFEGUARDS ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY

The duties of Corporate Bodies and functions involved in the adoption of the Engagement Policy are formalised

in internal operating mandates and related powers of representation and are set out in the company

organisation chart and organisational code, as well as in internal operating procedures.

The next sections report on:

− the procedural safeguards adopted by the Company, in implementation of sector regulations and related

self-governance measures;

− the roles and responsibilities of the entities involved in the process to manage the “corporate governance“

of investee issuers.

INTERNAL REGULATIONS

The Company adopted, in compliance with sector regulations, specific organisational measures and/or

procedures aimed at ensuring, where discretionary rights have been attributed regarding the administration

and voting relative to its shareholdings in investee companies, the independence and autonomy in exercising

such rights. In this context, the Company has set out a specific voting strategy.

In this regard, the Company has adopted special internal procedures, suitably formalized, relating to the procedures for

exercising the right to intervene and vote inherent in "managed" shareholdings and describing the safeguards put in place

to ensure alignment with the provisions of EU and national regulations. Participation in Shareholders’ meetings takes

place in the sole interest of managed portfolios and market integrity, with the aim of minimizing the risk of

conflicts of interest. In conflict situations, the Company shall in any case act so as to ensure fair treatment, in

compliance with applicable Group and Company policies.

As regards the individual portfolio management service, specific provisions in contract documentation are

envisaged, to exclude the exercise of voting rights by the Company, reserving said right to managed clients.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Company assigns importance to monitoring and engagement with its investee companies, as well as

participation in the relevant Shareholders' Meetings.

To promote a correct adoption of its own Engagement Policy, the Company has established a framework

involving the following corporate bodies and entities:

The Compliance \& AML Function reports every six months to the Independent Directors Committee on controls

rights for financial instruments of assets managed by the Company.

PART III - MEASURES ADOPTED TO IMPLEMENT THE “ITALIAN STEWARDSHIP PRINCIPLES”

POLICY OF THE EXERCISE OF PARTICIPATION AND VOTING RIGHTS

As set forth in Directive 2010/43/EU (which describes the methods for implementing Directive 2009/65/EC, as

regards organizational requirements, conflicts of interests, conduct of business, risk management and content

of agreements entered into between a depositary and a management company) and related implementing

regulations (CSSF Regulation 10-4 of December 22nd, 2010), the Company has adopted a set of procedures

and measures aimed at:

− monitor corporate events related to the financial instruments held in the managed portfolio, where required

by the characteristics of the financial instruments that incorporate the rights to be exercised;

− assess the methods and times for any possible exercise of participation and voting rights, based on a cost-

benefit analysis that also considers the objectives and investment policy of each managed portfolio;

− prevent or manage any conflict of interest situations that may arise from the exercise of voting rights on

behalf of assets under management.

In particular, based on a cost/benefit analysis that takes into account the investment objectives and policies of

the managed products, the Company has adopted preliminary and operating processes that differ for the

exercise of voting rights, depending on whether the decision concerns resolutions of shareholders’ meetings:

− considered more significant, based on one or more of the following criteria;

− for which the Company uses electronic voting (proxy voting).

Based on the above, the Company has defined the following criteria to identify meetings of the most significant

Engagement policy Pagina 9 di 14



shareholders:

− holding significant amounts of capital, identified from time to time in company procedures;

− the presence of situations in relation to which, in the interests of managed assets, it intends (i) reporting on

situations of particular interest, in defence of or supporting the interests of minority shareholders; or (ii)

supporting decisions referred to environmental, social and good corporate governance practices;

− the appointment of statutory auditors or board directors of companies listed in Italy based on list voting,

representing minority shareholders;

− it resolves on extraordinary transactions considered significant for the interest of managed assets, in order

to support or oppose a proposed operation.

If considered the most efficient procedure in the interest of managed assets and if the above

qualitative/quantitative criteria do not apply, the Company also exercises voting rights by electronic voting, if

contemplated by issuers. To this end, ECSA uses an IT platform to streamline the process of exercising voting

rights, with particular reference to foreign issuers.

ECSA may opt to not exercise a voting right in cases where the situation might not benefit the managed assets,

for example:

- overall, the Company has a marginal investment;

- it is necessary to block the availability of financial instruments for a period of time considered too long,

which would influence management strategies;

- he agenda of the shareholders’ meeting does not envisage the discussion of significant topics;

- the necessary administrative costs, also considering expected procedures in some countries, are

considered to outweigh the expected benefits of participation in the meeting, above all in the case of

positions arising from short-term investment strategies.

The Company undertakes to adopt and apply the Strategy, to ensure that participation and voting rights are

exercised in the exclusive interest of investor participants

The Company monitors the effectiveness of the measures for exercising participation and voting rights and, in

any case, reviews the Strategy adopted at least annually.

The Strategy and any updates are available to UCI participants, at www.eurizoncapital.com.

MONITORING METHODS FOR PARTICIPATING ISSUERS

The Company shall actively monitors corporate events related to the financial instruments in the portfolio of

managed UCIs, where required by the characteristics of the instruments that incorporate the rights to be

exercised.

The aim is to identify issues in advance, while minimising any potential loss of value arising from aspects

related to the corporate performance of the companies in which it invests on behalf of the assets under

management, as well as any significant negative impact of investment decisions on the sustainability factors

identified within the individual managed products.

The main stages of the engagement activities adopted by the Company, with the support of the ESG \&

Strategic Activism of the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR are summarised below:



PREPARATION PERFORMANCE CLOSURE



Identification of issuers to

contact also according to the

"macro-themes" of interest to

the Company; analysis of

public material available to

identify the engagement focus.



− The start of engagement activities with the

identified company: exchange may take place

by email, through online or face-to-face

meetings.

− Evaluation of information obtained from the

issuer and evaluation of the advisability of

extending engagement or of taking escalation

measures.

− Start of an escalation process



Closure of engagement

activities if feedback is

considered satisfactory.

In the case of a negative

outcome of any escalation

action, the Company will

evaluate the possible disposal

of the assets.



The Company, through its Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR, is involved in initiatives at national and

international level which promote the integration of sustainability principles in the financial sector; it participates

Engagement policy Pagina 10 di 14



in work groups for the development of ESG-related best practices, and in training events and conferences, to

share its experience.

In particular, the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR, as a signatory:

− of the United Nations’ “Principles for Responsible Investment” (UN PRI), it pays particular attention to the

policies adopted by the issuers in which it invests assets under management, believing that sound

sustainability policies and practices (covering environmental, social and governance issues) can create

long-term shareholder value;

− of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI) and the associated long-term commitments made in

relation to it, attaches importance to climate risks, energy and climate transition plans, and transparency

regarding greenhouse gas emissions caused directly and indirectly by investee companies, especially with

regard to the most polluting sectors.

In this context, the Company has also adopted a methodology for the selection of financial instruments which

takes into account the principles the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors and principles of

Sustainable and Responsible Investments (SRI). These strategies, intended to integrate sustainability risks in

the Investment Process for managed assets, are governed in the “Eurizon Capital S.A. Sustainability Policy”,

of which a summary is available on the Company’s website.

Indeed, the Company believes that environmental, social and corporate governance factors have an impact

on portfolio performance, and that the adoption of ESG and SRI criteria can contribute to improve the ability

to respond more effectively to Clients’/Investors’ expectations, aligning investment activities with the broader

interests of issuers.

The escalation process and related restrictions are applied to all actively managed products, both benchmark

and flexible.

In fact, the Company believes that environmental, social and corporate governance factors impact portfolio

performance, and that the adoption of ESG and SRI criteria can contribute to improving the ability to respond

more effectively to Clients’/Investors’ expectations, aligning investment activities with the wider-ranging

interests of issuers.

To this end, the Company gives priority to establishing a constructive dialogue with investee issuers concerned

with the following macro-issues, covering all industrial sectors:

− climate change mitigation and adaptation;

− biodiversity loss mitigation and offsetting deforestation;

− respect for human rights, and combating the production of non-conventional weapons;

− good corporate governance practices.

For each of these , the Company encourages investee companies to improve their processes by considering

- where appropriate - the definition of suitable corrective actions. For the purposes of comparison with investee

issuers, the Company considers the activities carried out by issuers and their alignment with the provisions of

the Taxonomy Regulation on environmental sustainability. In order to optimise its engagement initiatives, the

Company reserves the right to assess the materiality of additional areas of interest, also depending on the

sector to which the issuing companies belong, such as, for example, gender diversity and aspects of

cybersecurity, including the use of Artificial Intelligence tools.

CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION

The Company considers that institutional investors should analyse companies and related sectors in order to

assess their energy transition potential, with the aim of exercising participation and voting rights in an informed,

consistent manner.

To mitigate the impact of investments on the climate, the Company’s Sustainability Policy envisages specific

exclusions or restrictions for2 issuers operating in sectors considered “not responsible”, providing for specific

engagement processes with companies that have a greater exposure, also with the aim of ensuring that no

new projects are started, and that the gradual phase out of these activities is monitored. The ESG \& Strategic



2 The exclusions are applied to all active management products, while in the case of Limited Tracking Error products and

index-linked products (with the exception of those that specifically integrate ESG factors), the maximum direct investment

allowed is equal to the weight of the issuer in the sustainable benchmark.

Engagement policy Pagina 11 di 14



Activism Function of the Parent Company Eurizon Capital SGR monitors engagement initiatives aimed at

establishing a constructive dialogue with the issuers identified, notifying the results to the ESG Committee.

Lastly, the Company, with the support of the ESG \& Strategic Activism Function of the Parent Company

Eurizon Capital SGR, encourages investee issuers operating in the Energy sector, in particular "Oil \& Gas"

and "Electric Utilities" companies, (i) to adopt and publish targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

including methane emissions, both in the short- and medium-term, according to strategies in line with the Paris

Agreement; (ii) to commit to gradually reducing (so-called 'phase-down') the production and use of fossil fuels

such as coal, oil and natural gas/methane until these activities are phased out (so-called 'phase-out'); (iii) to

adopt and publish information on own investment plans and provide periodic progress reports; (iv) to present

their transition plans to the shareholders at Annual General Meetings (so-called 'Say on Climate' vote).

BIODIVERSITY LOSS MITIGATION AND FIGHTING DEFORESTATION

Companies can generate negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, including through their own value

chains, by contributing to (i) land and sea exploitation resulting from deforestation, conversion for agriculture

and aquaculture; (ii) climate change brought about by pollution; (iii) the spread of invasive species; and (iv)

unsustainable fishing, hunting and farming practices that can adversely affect animal and plant populations.

Land use, including deforestation, is among the most significant drivers of biodiversity loss also due to

increased emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

The Company encourages issuers to take measures to counter biodiversity loss and deforestation by

promoting (i) transparency in the sourcing and use of raw materials, (ii) the adoption of circular economy

practices and reuse of materials, and (iii) continued commitment to more sustainable standards, including with

respect to the supply chain.

In dealing with investee issuers, the Company encourages:

- the adoption by issuers in risk sectors, of effective strategies and policies to preserve biodiversity that

include the involvement of management and corporate bodies;

- the presence of due-diligence processes of the company's supply chain, including how it collaborates with

stakeholders and/or participates in industry-relevant initiatives;

- investment in research and development aimed at conserving and mitigating biodiversity loss;

- transparency both on commitments made, including to local communities, and in the presence of any

disputes.

In this regard, the Company encourages companies to disclose information about their impact on nature and

ecosystems, in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD).

Consistent with the Parent Company’s membership in the Nature Action 100 collective engagement initiative,

the Company is committed to requiring identified companies:

- an explicit corporate commitment to mitigating biodiversity loss and protecting ecosystems;

- assessment and reporting of biodiversity-related impacts, risks and opportunities, including along the

respective value chains;

- to communicate (i) time-bound targets, specific to the operating context, for reducing risks and exploiting

opportunities related to natural capital, and to publish annual progress against stated targets, (ii) the plan

to achieve them, and (iii) progress achieved;

- review by their respective oversight bodies of matters pertaining to biodiversity conservation and

preservation and management's assessment and management of nature-related dependencies, impacts,

risks and opportunities;

- engagement with Stakeholders to create an environment conducive to the implementation of identified

plans and the achievement of set goals.

RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, AND COMBATING THE PRODUCTION OF NON-CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS;

In line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, the Company encourages issuers to develop

policies and practices aimed at an effective management of their own human capital. The companies are

required to protect worker health and safety throughout the production chain and to commit to fostering a

Engagement policy Pagina 12 di 14



company culture that ensures good health and safety practices, putting in place a clear management system

for monitoring, and if necessary, adopting corrective measures.

The Company expects issuers to implement due diligence processes to prevent and mitigate risks related to

human capital management, including the violation of fundamental human rights, including in the supply chain.

With regard to compliance with international human rights standards, the Company encourages its investee

companies to adopt corporate policies on respect for human and labour rights and welcomes the adoption of

internationally recognised human rights principles.

With regard to the production of unconventional weapons, the Company’s Sustainability Policy provides for

specific exclusions or restrictions for issuers that are clearly involved directly in the manufacture of non-

conventional weapons.

The Company may start engagement with issuers, with the aim of further reviewing their compliance with

international treaties and national laws. Based on information obtained, the Company evaluates the feasibility

of starting escalation processes.

GOOD CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

The Company believes that issuers who adopt robust corporate governance practices are able to manage

corporate risks more efficiently. For this reason, it promotes a constructive approach with companies it invests

in and is aware of the importance of dialogue in corporate governance practices. The Company has therefore

adopted principles of conduct to observe when evaluating proposals on the agenda of key shareholder

meetings, taking into account market best practices.

As part of its monitoring activities, the Company also requests listed investee issuers and their advisors to

ensure that any information which could compromise the ability to trade the financial instruments of such

issuers are not disclosed without prior consent.

The Head of Investments monitors, also with the support of the ESG \& Strategic Activism structure of the

outsourcer Eurizon Capital SGR, the evolution of the performance, corporate governance and sustainability of

the participated companies, in order to evaluate the activation of a comparison with the representatives of the

companies invested. The purpose of this interaction is to identify any problems in advance and minimize, at

the same time, potential losses in value.

In this context, the monitoring activity is complementary both to the analysis of investments and to the exercise

of voting rights because it makes it possible to address specific governance concerns of issuers, avoiding, in

the first instance, to assess the disposal of the shareholding or voting against it.

CONSIDERATION OF PRINCIPAL ADVERSE IMPACTS ON SUSTAINABILITY FACTORS

In line with the provisions of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288, the assessment of the Principal Adverse

Impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors and the definition of possible measures to mitigate

them are an integral part of Eurizon's approach to sustainability.

In this context, the Company has a specific framework that defines how Principal Adverse Impact indicators

are taken into account within the assets under management, in accordance with the SFDR implementation

rules and in line with the sustainability risk integration strategies adopted for each product.

The following table shows the mapping of the Principal Adverse Impact indicators taken into account in the

dialogue with investee companies:

Within the framework of Principle No. 3, the SGR defines when and how to intervene and the related escalation

processes to be activated in the event of an unsatisfactory outcome of dialogue activities.

Lastly, it is reported that the Company publishes the mitigation actions adopted in the “Principal Adverse

Sustainability Impacts Statement of Eurizon Capital SGR S.P.A. and Its Subsidiaries” made available on the

Company website.

COLLABORATION WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS:

In addition, the Company can activate a further process of comparison with its participated companies,

promoting, for example, joint collaboration with other institutional investors.

The Company recognises the benefits that may derive from the activation of forms of collective engagement

with other investors. In particular, the Company assesses this solution when it considers it the most effective

choice to improve communication with issuers. This may occur in the event of significant corporate events or

issues of public interest.

Any method of collective engagement is conducted in compliance with internal and external regulations on the

management of conflicts of interest and on insider information (market abuse), paying particular attention to

regulations on concerted action.

In addition, the Company may collectively carry out monitoring, participation and engagement activities also

through participation in the activities of the Corporate Governance Committee and the Committee of Managers

promoted by Italian industry association Assogestioni.

CONSCIOUS EXERCISE OF VOTING RIGHTS

The Company adopts a "targeted" approach to corporate governance by participating in the Shareholders'

Meetings of selected companies with shares listed on the Italian Stock Exchange and international markets,

taking into account the usefulness of participating in the interests of the assets under management and the

possibility of influencing decisions in relation to the voting shares held.

Participation in the Shareholders' Meetings of other companies is in any case envisaged if significant amounts

of capital are held or is considered significant in the interest of the assets managed.

The Head of Investments defines the proposals relating to voting instructions on the basis of the analyses and

in-depth analyses carried out on public documents, the results of any interaction with the issuing company, the

indications provided by advisors specialised in research to support corporate governance decisions and voting

recommendations, as well as the indications provided by the relevant Managers.

To support its investment decisions and the exercise of its participation and voting rights, the Company may

also use the services of a voting consultant (proxy advisor, to streamline - in accordance with the principle of

proportionality - the analyses preparatory to the definition of voting instructions. Recommendations made by

this advisor are not binding and the Company undertakes to make, in the best interest of managed assets,

voting decisions that differ from both proxy advisor’s and investee’s management recommendations. In any

case, the Company actively liaises with its advisor, to avoid any risk of over-reliance.

The Company pay particular attention to the policies adopted by the issuers in which it invests, in the belief

that sound corporate governance policies and practices (which incorporate environmental, social and

governance issues) are able to create value for shareholder in the long-term. In this context, in support of

investment decisions and the exercise of participation and voting rights, the Company has adopted specific

methodologies to select financial instruments which take account of the Environmental, Social and Governance

(ESG) factors and principles of Sustainable and Responsible Investments (SRI).

The Company considers exercising the right to vote concerning financial instruments of managed assets

issued by group companies or by companies with whom the Company, its significant members or group

companies have strategic relations or in relation to which group companies of ECSA appoint one or more

members of corporate bodies as a conflict of interest. Therefore, the Company has adopted the Protocol of

Autonomy for the management of conflicts of interest prepared by Assogestioni with the aim of safeguarding

the Company's decision-making autonomy in its choices concerning the provision of management services. In

this context, as a preventive measure to neutralise the same, the Company does not exercise the right to vote

concerning shares of managed assets issued by companies that are directly or indirectly parents, or in relation

to whom ECSA Group companies appoint or designate one or more members of the company boards. The

Company may still aggregate shares of managed assets issued by these companies in order to reach the

Engagement policy Pagina 14 di 14



minimum quota of holdings required by the regulations in force for presenting lists of candidates for the

renewal of the corporate positions in question.



With reference to procedures to exercise participation and voting rights, ECSA may delegate - for each single

meeting, specialist third-party companies, giving them specific voting instructions. In any case, ECSA does not

delegate Group companies or officers to exercise the right to vote concerning shares of managed assets, apart

from the case of another management company, and ensures, in any event, that the delegated party exercises

the right to vote in compliance with the interest of participants in the UCIs or their clients.

REPORTING

The Company provides on its website the "Engagement Policy" and the "Voting Procedure for financial

instruments of managed assets of Eurizon Capital S.A.” showing its commitment to high standards of external

corporate governance.

In addition, the Company provides transparent disclosure of activities to exercise participation and voting rights

through:

− its website, publishing information at regular intervals participation in the Shareholders' Meetings and on

the engagement, with reference to companies whose securities are present in the portfolios of the managed

UCIs;

- the Report on the management of the UCIs, in which details on the vote cast and conduct adopted.

These documents include both qualitative and quantitative information.

The Company attaches importance to formalising the documentation necessary to ensure complete traceability

of the decision-making process adopted to exercise participation and voting rights and engage with the issuers.

The updating of the Engagement Policy is carried out by the Head of Investments, who is supported by the

Company's and Parent Company’s competent structures.

The Compliance \& AML Function periodically checks the correct application and effectiveness of the measures

adopted by the Company for the purposes of implementing the regulations in force from time to time.

PART IV - UPDATES AND TRANSPARENCY

CONTROLS AND UPDATES

The Engagement Policy is periodically revised, or if significant circumstances occur that require an amendment

and/or addition, so that the definition of the conduct the Company is committed to adopting, is updated at all

times, also to take account of changes in its own organisation and the services it provides, and to maintain a

high level of oversight of solutions identified to mitigate any conflicts of interest detected.

Proposals to amend the Policy are monitored by Investments Department in coordination with the Compliance

\& AML Function in order to assess the consistency of the methodologies adopted by the Company in relation

to developments in national and international best practices.

TRANSPARENCY

In compliance with indications in applicable regulations, the Company makes this Policy available to

Clients/investors and other stakeholders, and any significant amendment to the same, at
