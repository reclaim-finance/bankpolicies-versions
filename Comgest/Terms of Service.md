I. INTRODUCTION



The Comgest Group 1 (the “Group”) is an independent equity-focused asset manager with a QualityGrowth investment philosophy that has guided our portfolios consistently for over three decades. Ouraim is to deliver above-average risk-adjusted returns to our clients over time across global equitymarkets.

As stewards of capital, we look to preserve the long-term interests of our clients by investing incompanies where we believe the financial returns are sustainable over the long run. This includesassessing the social and environmental impacts of our investee companies to determine whether theysupport conditions for sustainable growth.

We are conscious of the trust that has been placed in our company when clients invest with us. Ourinvestment beliefs underpin our business model and our business strategy is implicitly linked to howwe invest for clients.



A. OUR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY

We engage in responsible investment because we believe it enhances our financial performance aslong-term investors and delivers multiple forms of value to our clients. Responsible investment hasalways been an integral part of our investment philosophy and approach because we believe that:

– Markets may fail to correctly value businesses with strong and sustainable competitiveadvantage and persistent above-average earnings growth;

– The integration of environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors enables a betterassessment of quality; and

– Sustainable value creation is enhanced when companies deliver social utility, integrity anddifferentiation.We believe that a company’s responsible approach to ESG factors will positively impact their growthover the long-term. In assessing these factors carefully, the integration of our proprietary ESG researchinto our fundamental analysis enables Comgest’s Investment team to perform a more comprehensiveassessment of “quality”. We also know that value for our clients derives not only from the financialreturns we deliver or the service we provide but the consistency and transparency of our responsibleinvestment approach.



B. OBJECTIVES OF OUR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT APPROACH

With the implementation of our Responsible Investment Policy (“RI Policy”), Comgest strives to achievethe following objectives:



– Enhance the risk-adjusted return of our portfolios over our long-term investment horizon by:

 Improving our assessment of both quality and risk for each company, by thoroughlyintegrating ESG-related risks and opportunities into our research; and

 Enhancing long-term performance through our active ownership strategy 2 ; this includesencouraging investee companies to improve their disclosure and ESG risk mitigation practicesas well as harnessing ESG opportunities;

– Discover investment opportunities through the assessment of companies positioned to benefitfrom ESG-related competitive advantages and growth engines;

– Ensure the responsible stewardship of our clients’ assets.

C. WHAT ENABLES US TO IMPLEMENT OUR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT APPROACH?

– Our long-term investment horizon enables us to engage with companies over the long-term,striving for continual improvement. We seek to deliver value to our clients by utilising time-horizon arbitrage, looking beyond the short-term market “noise” to identify drivers of long-termperformance.

– Comgest has always been 100% owned by employees and founders. We regard our independentand broad ownership structure as a key advantage to implement an unbiased and effectiveengagement and advocacy strategy.

– Our experience integrating ESG into our investment analysis as part of our Quality Growthapproach. Comgest has focused on long-term, Quality Growth investing for over three decades.We became a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment (“PRI”) in 2010, hired our firstESG Analyst in 2012 and formalised our Group-level Responsible Investment Policy in 2016.

– We believe that our proprietary ESG research performed by diverse, on-the-ground teams withlocal language skills and cultural knowledge allows us to make more informed investmentdecisions.

– Our ESG Analysts are fully embedded within the Investment team to work alongside ourCompany Analysts, attending company meetings, performing research and conductingproprietary ESG Assessments.



II. SCOPE



Our RI Policy applies to all of Comgest’s assets under management worldwide.



III. RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT STRATEGY



Comgest implements a three-pronged Responsible Investment Strategy (“RI Strategy”):



Figure 1. Comgest three-pronged RI Strategy

5 / COMGEST GROUP RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT POLICY 2025 comgest.com



– Integration: We conduct proprietary company research as part of our bottom-up stock selectionprocess. We form our own opinions on the ESG profile of each company based on thisfundamental research. Our assessment of ESG factors is incorporated throughout our investmentprocess. We maintain an Exclusion Policy 3 that defines our limits to exposure regarding activitieswhere ESG-related risks tend to be more significant.

– Active ownership: As long-term investors managing concentrated portfolios, we engage with ourinvestee companies to exchange information and drive improvements on ESG topics over time.As shareholders, we recognise voting as a key tool for active ownership. We are intentional in theimplementation of our proprietary voting policy, adapting its principles to each company’sunique circumstances. This approach may lead us to vote against management or even our ownpolicy, demonstrating our commitment to active voting.

– Partnership: We strive to work together with our clients as responsible stewards of their capital.This means sharing knowledge and developing an understanding of our clients’ specific prioritiesregarding responsible investment.

As part of our partnership strategy, we join efforts with other like-minded investors or industrybodies to engage with companies and other industry participants when we believe this can drivemore effective and/or more timely positive change.Comgest’s values and responsible investment philosophy are anchored in transparency. Just as wedemand transparent disclosures from our investee companies, we aim to provide high quality andcomprehensive communication concerning our responsible investment activities. When reportingon our responsible investment activities, we provide details of our achievements (e.g. engagementsuccesses) as well as our limitations, lessons learned (e.g. ESG-related divestments) and ourambitions for improvement.We deliver this transparency through our regular client reporting, our discussions with clients, ourresponses to bespoke ESG information requests and the publication of ESG-related disclosures.



A. INTEGRATE

i. Defining sustainability risks



Comgest believes that the consideration of sustainability risks (or ESG-related risks) in the investmentdecision-making process can enhance financial outcomes.

Sustainability risk means an environmental, social or governance event or condition that, if it occurs,could cause an actual or a potential material negative impact on the value of an investment.Sustainability risks are the potential negative consequences (financial, legal or reputational) to abusiness that may result from its impact (or perceived impact) on the natural environment (such as air,water or soil), on the stakeholders of the entity (including employees, customers and localcommunities) or from shortcomings in a company’s management structure (such as misbehaviour,corruption, failure to adequately vindicate shareholder rights or lack of tax compliance). Theoccurrence and significance of sustainability risks vary between sectors and geographical locations.



ii. Defining Principal Adverse Impacts



Comgest believes that enhanced outcomes can also be achieved from the consideration of PrincipalAdverse Impacts (“PAI”) in the investment decision-making process.

PAIs on sustainability factors are negative material or likely material impacts of a firm’s investmentdecisions on sustainability factors.

Please refer to our Principle Adverse Sustainability Impacts Statement.



3 See Appendix V for Comgest’s Group-level Exclusion Policy.

6 / COMGEST GROUP RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT POLICY 2025 comgest.com



iii. Considering sustainability risks and PAIs in our investment decision-making process



The manner in which we take sustainability risks and PAIs into consideration is through our ESGintegration process. ESG factors and PAI indicators are incorporated into the investment decision-making process with the objective of improving the long-term financial and sustainability-relatedoutcomes of our clients’ portfolios, consistent with their objectives. This approach ensures that theInvestment team is aware of an investee company’s sustainability risks, including those that couldhave a material impact on returns and PAI indicators that could have a material impact on theenvironment and society. Comgest ensures that sustainability risks and opportunities as well as PAIindicators are taken into account in a systematic manner.



iv. ESG integration process

a. What are the types of ESG factors that we consider throughout our process?



ESG factors that we specifically consider, depending on their materiality to the business in question,include the following:



ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE

– Greenhouse gases

emissions

– Energy use and efficiency

– Deforestation

– Raw materialsconsumption

– Biodiversity and itsprotection

– Air, water and groundpollution

– Water and wastemanagement

– Lifecycle impacts andcircular economy



– Social utility

– Labour practices andworking conditions,health \& safety

– Product safety andquality

– Data privacy and security

– Diversity, equity andinclusion

– Supply chainmanagement

– Relationships withstakeholders: customers,communities,governments/regulators,suppliers, unions etc.



– Culture and ethics

– Shareholder rights

– Audit and accounting

– Corruption and bribery

– Board and boardcommitteecharacteristics includingdiversity

– Board membercompetence

– Independence

– Compensation

– Management structure

– Risk management

– Transparency

– Tax compliance

In Comgest’s ESG research, priority is given to what we consider the most material ESG issues which arelikely to have an impact on companies and their ecosystem for sustainable development. This focus onmateriality allows us to monitor key issues and to use the results of our research for valuation purposesas explained in section III.A.v., Impact on valuation.

Comgest monitors and manages climate, biodiversity and human rights related risks as part of our ESGrisk assessment process (see Appendices II, III and IV for more information).

Comgest adopts an ESG integration approach which aligns well with our investment style focused onbottom-up stock picking of quality growth companies.

\* Please see section III.A.v., Impact on valuation for further information .



b. Investment process step-by-step



1. Broad screen of market



Within the evolving universe of potential investments, we look for companies that demonstrate avariety of quality growth criteria (examples of criteria illustrated in Figure 3). This broad screen of themarket is carried out by the Company Analysts and ESG Analysts and considers both financial andextra-financial quality growth criteria. This occurs on a continuous basis through evaluation by theInvestment team, contact with companies as well as through industry and other sources, such asbroker research and the occasional use of screening tools.



Figure 3: Examples of Comgest’s quality growth criteria

8 / COMGEST GROUP RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT POLICY 2025 comgest.com



2. Watchlist



Where companies pass our initial screening, they are considered as potential investment ideas and areadded to a “Watchlist”. The Investment team conducts the following activities for Watchlist companies:



– Fundamental analysis of companies, competition, markets and ESG factors

– Assessment of growth potential using qualitative analysis and proprietary forecasts

– Meetings with management and, potentially, with competitors, suppliers, customers andindustry experts

We are focused on conducting our own fundamental in-house research and will collaborate withspecialised industry consultants to access key insights. The integration of ESG analysis is an importantresearch element in building conviction levels about the quality and sustainability of the businessmodel of a company. ESG research during this phase may also lead to identifying significant ESG-related competitive advantages and growth engines.



3. Investment Universe



Comgest’s Investment Universe for each strategy represents a list of quality growth companies thathave been rigorously selected and may be included in portfolios. A unanimous decision by all membersin attendance at the team meeting is required for inclusion in the Investment Universe. Assessingwhether a stock will make Comgest’s “quality growth grade” is a rigorous and often lengthy process. Itcan take anywhere from several months to several years to build the necessary conviction.

When moving from the Watchlist to the Investment Universe of eligible companies, Company Analystsand ESG Analysts identify what they believe to be the most material sustainability issues, includingthose that could have an impact on a company’s performance and share price.

We analyse how the identified ESG risks contribute to broad risk headings such as governance risk,reputation risk, regulatory and litigation risk, operational risk, demand shift risk, sourcing/ supplychain risk and corporate culture risk, recognising that the materiality of certain ESG risks can vary byindustry and/or by region.

During this research phase, our Investment team may start a direct dialogue with companies to furtherconstruct our investment and sustainability thesis. These discussions are helpful in cases where data isless available and where there is less certainty about the ESG profile of a company.



4. Valuation



The team constructs conservative five-year earnings and dividend discount models for all InvestmentUniverse stocks, based on proprietary estimates. The discount rates we use in valuations take intoaccount country risk, equity risk and ESG risks/opportunities identified throughout the process.

For companies that have been assigned an ESG Quality Level, a company-specific ESG discount rate isapplied to the overall discount rate used in the company valuation process. Impacts can be eitherpositive or negative, depending on whether the ESG Quality Level reflects a risk or opportunity. See

section III.A.v., Impact on valuation for further information.



Discount rate components:



\* For companies with an assigned ESG Quality Level

Risk-free rate(country/regional government bond yield)+Equity risk premium+Company risk factor: business model+ESG rating impact\*

5. Portfolio construction



Based on team discussions, we select companies from the Investment Universe to create concentratedportfolios, assigning weightings based on the relative attractiveness of each company. When adding acompany to a portfolio, ESG integration contributes to all three components used in determining theweight of a holding:



– Earnings visibility/ quality of the business

– Attractiveness of valuation

– Level of growth



Figure 4: ESG in portfolio construction



Each of these three characteristics involves elements of our ESG integration process:



EARNINGS VISIBILITY / QUALITY OF BUSINESS

The portfolio managers carefully consider the visibility of a company’s future earnings which dependson the overall “quality” of the business according to our selection criteria. In this assessment, manyESG-related items are considered, such as governance structure, stakeholder relationships,transparency of management, controversies and other material sustainability risks and adverseimpacts.



ATTRACTIVENESS OF VALUATION

ESG considerations are taken into account within the company-specific discount rate used in ourmodels (section III.A.iv., Impact on valuation), directly impacting the calculation of potential upside(financial return) with reference to a company’s prevailing stock market valuation. Lower ESG risk leadsto higher potential upside, a factor considered in the position sizing process.



LEVEL OF GROWTH

The ESG profile of a company can impact our estimate of the level of growth. Companies with strongESG credentials may have a higher probability of delivering longer duration growth. We are likely toassign a lower confidence level to forecasted growth rates to companies with significant ESG risks thatmay materialise into financial risks over our 5-year investment horizon.



Comgest is prepared to invest in companies with a lower ESG Quality Level where there is an identifiedopportunity for improvement. In such cases, the company’s heightened ESG risk is reflected in thehigher discount rate applied to the valuation, which impacts the Investment team’s projected upside onthe stock. Where companies identified for improvements have not demonstrated progress towardsthose measures over time despite our engagement with them, Comgest may escalate its engagementwith the company or eventually divest.

10 / COMGEST GROUP RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT POLICY 2025 comgest.com



6. Ongoing monitoring and controversy screening



Investee companies across all strategies are monitored on an ongoing basis from an ESG perspective.The primary objective of this ongoing monitoring is to identify any significant ESG-related events—suchas controversies or any developments that could negatively impact a company's ESG/quality profile,valuation, or overall reputation.

This monitoring is conducted systematically for all strategies using third party tools that provide timelyupdates on new controversies. The tools enable the ESG team to stay informed about developmentsthat could impact portfolio companies.

When such alerts highlight material events, the ESG Analyst works closely with the Company Analystto revise, where necessary, the company’s ESG Assessment. Depending on the severity of the issue, theinvestment thesis for the affected company may also be re-evaluated.

Additionally, the ESG Analyst and the Company Analyst may engage directly with a portfolio companyin instances where significant areas of concern are identified. The aim of this engagement is toencourage improvements on specific ESG issues flagged as part of the ongoing monitoring andcontroversy review. If necessary, we may further escalate the matter through voting.



c. ESG exclusions



To help reduce risks linked to ESG factors, we may apply targeted exclusion policies for certainactivities where sustainability risks or adverse impacts tend to be more significant (includingcontroversial weapons, tobacco and coal). For further information on our Exclusion Policy please referto our Comgest Group Exclusion Policy (Appendix V) as well as our Comgest Plus Exclusion Policy.



d. A differentiated approach for Article 8 products: ESG review of the investable universe



For Comgest’s public funds classified as Article 8 under the European Union’s Sustainable FinanceDisclosure Regulation (“SFDR”) as well as certain mandates, we undertake an ESG review of theinvestable universe to identify companies that are eligible for inclusion in the top 80% of the investableuniverse.



1. Definition of the investable universe

For the purposes of the ESG review, the investable universe is defined as the constituents of thecomparative index for the fund (or a different appropriate index where specified in the funddocumentation), with the addition of companies not listed in the relevant index and which Comgest hasidentified as potentially eligible for investment by the fund.

2. Identification of the top 80% ESG performers within the investable universe



The investable universe is assessed through the application of the negative and positive screeningprocesses described below to allocate companies with weaker ESG credentials to the bottom 20%:



− Negative ESG screening



Comgest first applies its Exclusion Policy (please refer to our Comgest Group Exclusion Policy in AppendixV for details) and additional norms based and activity-based ESG screening to the investable universe.This process aims to eliminate companies engaged in activities with higher environmental or social risks.It includes normative screening which evaluates companies' adherence to international norms andstandards, and activity-based screening which excludes companies involved in activities consideredharmful, such as those with substantial environmental, social, or governance risks. These companies areplaced in the bottom 20% of the investable universe.



− Positive ESG screening

11 / COMGEST GROUP RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT POLICY 2025 comgest.com



Companies with ESG ratings above a set threshold are then included in the top 80% of the investableuniverse. For this step, Comgest’s proprietary rating system is used. Comgest’s internal rating systemranging from 1 (ESG leader) to 4 (improvement expected) evaluates material ESG risks and opportunities.Companies rated between 1 (ESG leader) and 3 (Basic) are included in the top 80% of the investableuniverse.



− Adjustments using external ESG scoring



If the negative screening does not already encompass at least 20% of the investable universe, thencompanies not categorised pursuant to the negative or positive screening are assessed based on theirESG score assigned by an external data provider. Companies with the lowest overall external ESG scoreare added to the bottom 20% of the investable universe to reach 20%.

Where no external scoring is available, the company is either assessed internally or, where an internalassessment is not available, is not included in the review or, by consequence, in the investable universe.

At least 90% (based on number of investee companies) of the relevant fund’s investee companies mustbe from the top 80% of the investable universe.



v. Impact on Valuation

a. Definition of the ESG Quality Level



As a result of our proprietary ESG assessment process, an overall ESG Quality Level may be assigned toeach company, ranging from 1 (leader) to 4 (improvement expected) using an internal rating system asillustrated in Table 1. The ESG Quality Level reflects the consensus opinion of the Company Analyst(s)and ESG Analyst(s).

Further information on Comgest’s governance principlescan be found in our Good Governance Policy (Appendix I) and our Active Ownership Policy.



b. Impact on company discount rates used in our valuation models



As displayed above, ESG Quality Levels result in a company-specific ESG discount rate being applied tothe overall discount rate used in the company valuation process. Impacts can be either positive ornegative, depending on whether the ESG Quality Level reflects an overall ESG risk or opportunity.

As ranges of company discount rates are different according to whether it is a developed market or anemerging market Investment Universe, ranges of the ESG discount rate component also differaccordingly.

4 +200 bps 4 +300 bps



B. ACTIVE OWNERSHIP

We believe that active ownership is key to delivering long-term performance to our investors because itcan result in improvements to companies’ operations and earnings sustainability.

As long-term investors that manage high conviction, concentrated portfolios, our Investment teamresearches our investee companies intensely over many years. Analysts build deep knowledge ofcompanies’ businesses and ecosystems in which they operate. Developing strong relationships andmaintaining an active and open dialogue with investee companies is a key element of our researchprocess and, in extension, of our investment process.

In light of this investment approach, we are well-positioned to benefit from companies improving theirsustainability practices. Active ownership, combining company engagement, voting and broaderadvocacy efforts, is key to our strategy of delivering long-term performance to our investors.

Please refer to our Active Ownership Policy for details concerning our engagement and voting approachand principles, escalation process and our approach to managing ESG-related conflicts of interest.



C. PARTNERSHIP

i. Working alongside clients

a. Tailoring to bespoke ESG needs



Developing trusted partnerships with our clients is a key element of our investment philosophy. Weconsider it a privilege to manage assets on behalf of our clients and with this comes a duty tounderstand their needs and priorities, and to provide high-quality performance, servicing and reporting.Where possible, we help clients develop and implement their own policies as well as provide tailoredESG reporting.



b. Working together to drive change



As part of our active ownership strategy, we can partner with our clients in order to drive positivechange. Combined engagement activity is one of the ways we seek to drive positive change with ourinvestee companies.

ii. Advocacy initiatives



Our independent ownership structure is regarded as a key advantage to implementing an unbiased andsuccessful advocacy strategy.

14 / COMGEST GROUP RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT POLICY 2025 comgest.com



In delivering our highly active, quality growth investment approach, we seek to identify market-wideand systemic risks affecting the commercial and financial landscape in which issuers operate. We dothis through our own research and engagement and through our support for industry-wide initiatives.

While many sources of systemic risk are largely out of our direct control, such as the respect for therule of law in various countries, human rights and government policy, our policy is to engage activelywith industry participants, where possible, in an effort to collectively seek to reduce these risks overtime and to facilitate the better-functioning of financial markets. These initiatives help us to deepenour understanding of market-wide and systemic risks and add our weight to efforts to respond to them.They also provide us with an external lens through which we can analyse our effectiveness inresponding to such risks and any implications for our portfolio companies.

Our advocacy work may target industry participants such as regulators, policymakers, governmentsand a broad range of financial industry stakeholders (e.g. our peers, industry bodies, asset owners, SRIlabel providers, consultants, etc.). Our areas of advocacy focus may evolve according to ourengagement priorities.

We implement our advocacy activities either directly or by joining industry and/or collaborativeinitiatives. Activities may include the signing of investor statements, participation in public and privateworking groups and responding to industry consultations. We demonstrate our support by adhering toa number of industry Stewardship Codes (e.g., UK, US and Japan Stewardship Codes).The list of our advocacy activities can be found on our website.

– The Responsible Investment function is carried out by experienced investment professionals,each focused on company coverage within specific geographic regions. Importantly, they areembedded within Comgest’s Investment team, rather than operating as a siloed function. As anintegrated part of the investment team, the ESG Analysts work alongside our Company Analystsattending company meetings, performing research and conducting proprietary ESG Assessments.They also participate in proxy voting, individual company engagements and broad ESG research.

– The Responsible Development function comprises a specialist team leading thematic andcollaborative engagement on topics such as climate change, biodiversity, and human rights. Theteam oversees ESG strategy, advocacy initiatives, policies, regulations, internal training andcommunication of Comgest’s RI Strategy.

A number of other Comgest professionals are involved in Responsible Investment implementationincluding members of the middle office, project management, compliance, risk, legal, datamanagement, investor services and marketing \& communication teams.

C. INCENTIVES

Comgest’s broad employee partnership structure and its remuneration policy are designed toincentivise long-term thinking and behaviour.

With this structure, employees who have been with Comgest for several years typically becomepartners of the firm, meaning they are personally invested in the share capital. Comgest employs a mixof short- and long-term employee incentives which are reflected in our bonus systems and equityownership structure. Our underlying goal is for our incentive system to help drive long-term productperformance and team stability. We believe that the long‐term success of the company is dependentlargely on the long‐term success of the companies we invest in, which we strongly believe can beenhanced by ESG factors.



For the Investment team



All members of the Investment team are encouraged through their objectives and annual performanceevaluation to properly implement the RI Strategy and systematically take ESG factors into account intheir investment analysis and decision-making processes.

Variable compensation is based on a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria that favour processesand behaviour over outcomes. This is based on our belief that quality research inputs combined withsound methodology typically lead to positive outputs over the long-term. The assessment incorporatesresponsible investment criteria including ESG integration, identification of sustainability risks, qualityof engagement and participation in ESG training.



For Executive Committee members and other regulated entities’ board members



All members of the Executive Committee, as well as the board members of other regulated entities(except for external board members or independent board members), are encouraged through theirobjectives and annual performance evaluation to properly implement the RI Strategy.

Furthermore, award of variable compensation takes into consideration the successful achievement ofRI-related objectives. These objectives encompass a range of responsibilities, including the oversight ofthe RI Strategy's implementation, participation in RI-related training, and other relevant activities thatdemonstrate a commitment to advancing Comgest’s RI Strategy.

This alignment between remuneration and RI-related objectives reflects Comgest's dedication toembedding responsible investment practices within its governance structures, ensuring accountabilityand progress at the highest levels.



D. ESG TOOLS AND DATA

At Comgest, we value proprietary, fundamental analysis throughout our research process. To gatherESG information, we use our own research, the services of independent external service providers andinformation released by the companies themselves. Comgest’s ESG research is conducted internally bythe dedicated ESG Analysts and the Company Analysts. We do not rely solely on service providers’ data,we apply our own analysis and insights to the raw data supplied.

ESG data providers have been selected by Comgest based on information quality and geographicalcoverage criteria. Examples of providers used include:



– MSCI ESG Research: general ESG data, climate scenarios modelling, physical risks analysis

– BoardEx: governance information

– RepRisk: controversies and reputational risks

– S\&P Global Trucost: environmental data

– Bloomberg: ESG data

– Sustainalytics: controversies

Other sources of information are also used, such as companies’ sustainability reports, information andalerts by specialist providers, contacts with companies and their stakeholders, companies’ answers tothe CDP questionnaires (e.g. Climate Change, Water Security, Forests), brokers’ reports, NGO reports,media reports and academic research.

18 / COMGEST GROUP RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT POLICY 2025 comgest.com



In order to collect and share ESG data and information more efficiently within Comgest, we havedeveloped several in-house tools including central “dashboards” hosting key information at securityand portfolio level. We also maintain a bespoke ESG Assessment tool that summarises key metricsalongside our proprietary research on portfolio companies.

Greenwashing risk



Greenwashing is a term used to describe market practices in which an asset manager's publicly disclosedsustainability profile, or the characteristics and objectives of its financial product, do not accuratelyreflect the true sustainability profile of the asset manager or the financial product. This may occur eitherthrough deliberate actions or by omitting important and/or relevant information.

Comgest recognises the serious implications of greenwashing. It not only undermines investor confidencebut also threatens the integrity and fairness of the financial system. In light of these concerns, Comgesthas implemented a comprehensive approach to safeguard against greenwashing.

The Sustainability Committee plays a crucial role in this effort: it is responsible for regularly reviewingand monitoring Comgest’s ESG practices, ensuring that all activities align with the stated objectives.Additionally, the Committee annually reviews and approves a greenwashing risk mapping performed bythe ESG team and reviewed by Compliance. This risk mapping is designed to assess Comgest’s exposureto greenwashing risks and to facilitate the development of appropriate action plans to mitigate theserisks.

Comgest has implemented several measures to prevent and counteract greenwashing risks, including:

— Training: The training of Comgest staff on ESG related topics included greenwashing risks.



4 Visit our ESG library, available and regularly updated on our website.

20 / COMGEST GROUP RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT POLICY 2025 comgest.com



— Internal control framework: Comgest has implemented an industry-standard internalcontrol framework which uses three levels of controls to manage all risks includinggreenwashing-related risks.

— Transparent communication: A number of our reports and marketing materialscontaining ESG-related information communicated externally are reviewed and approved byour compliance teams. This process ensures that these materials are fair, balanced and do notpresent a greenwashing risk.

APPENDIX I: GOOD GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES AND POLICYFOR SFDR ARTICLE 8 PORTFOLIOS



This policy sets out additional information regarding Comgest’s general governance principles as wellas the assessment of good governance practices for investee companies within Comgest’s portfolioscategorised as promoting environmental or social characteristics under Article 8 of the EuropeanUnion’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (“SFDR”).

We believe that good governance is critical to the efficient and effective operation of any company. Inaccordance with the SFDR, all investee companies in SFDR Article 8 portfolios must follow several keygood governance practices as set out in section B below. Therefore, Comgest’s investment processsystematically considers these good governance practices for all stocks in these portfolios.

This policy forms part of our overall approach to responsible investment.



A. COMGEST’S GENERAL GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES

As set out in Comgest’s Active Ownership Policy, Comgest looks for and encourages all the companiesit invests in to apply the following four principles in their governance systems:



– Long-term performance orientation: companies should think big and plan long. Boards ofdirectors, management and employees should be responsible for ensuring continuousimprovement through all levels of the organisation. Innovation and initiative should be part ofthe corporate culture. We believe a long-term performance orientation leads to better personal,team and financial performance and encourages employees to “go the extra mile” for customersand shareholders.

– Accountability and transparency: executive and non-executive directors need to take fullownership of their duties and responsibilities, share information in a sufficiently open and timelymanner, be able to answer questions and explain decisions, uphold trust and confidence and befully accountable for the consequences of their actions.

– Honesty and integrity: compromising honesty and integrity can be disastrous for a company’simage, brand, morale and performance. Qualities, attributes and competencies that nurture andembrace honesty and integrity are vital to keeping a company whole, internally and externally.Companies should be vigilant, reliable and constantly seek to earn the trust of employees,customers and shareholders.

– Shared purpose and engagement: both executive and non-executive directors should align theirown interests with what is best for the company. Managers should lead by example with respectto all of the company’s stakeholders and successfully engage with them via their vision,leadership and capacity to inspire trust. Similarly, each employee should understand how his orher role contributes to the successful realisation of the company’s business purpose.Fundamentally, a company is a team and it takes a strong team of highly motivated people toachieve outstanding and sustainable long-term performance.

Comgest aims to encourage and reinforce the inherent values contained within these four principles. Inmaking our investment decisions, we look for companies that are led by executive directors and guidedby non-executive directors who embody, demonstrate and perpetuate these values.



B. GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

In assessing the good governance practices for portfolios subject to SFDR Article 8, we consider thegovernance indicators listed below:



i. Sound management structures



In order to assess the management structure of an investee company, Comgest evaluates thecompany’s board size, board structure, board independence, board gender diversity, board committees,board skill sets and any executive misconduct, among other factors.

22 / GOOD GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES AND POLICY comgest.com



ii. Tax compliance



In our view the effective tax rate of a company is a good proxy (when compared with the statutory taxrate) to gauge the contribution of the company to society. Indeed, when companies pay their fair shareto society (i.e., when they do not adopt irresponsible aggressive tax optimization strategies), theypositively contribute to the financing of pensions and health insurance systems, to publictransportation infrastructure, etc. This responsible behaviour allows companies to sustainably keeptheir social license to operate. This is why, with regard to tax information, we expect transparency fromcompanies to allow us to form our own view of their tax strategy. Notably we think country-by-countryreporting is a best-practice and we expect companies to report on tax-related risks.

To ensure our investee companies comply with their tax obligations, we assess the difference betweentheir effective tax rate and the weighted average of statutory rates or “tax gap”. We assess our investeecompanies’ disclosure on how they address tax-related risks, including information on overarchingpolicies and governance of the issue. We also take into consideration publicly reported cases ofinappropriate tax practices within our portfolio companies.



iii. Employee relations

We believe that investing in companies which show best practice when it comes to human capital willbetter manage downside risks while the best performers in this area will enjoy an improved risk/returnperformance. In assessing employee relations, we look at a company’s performance in the followingareas:



– Human rights and labour rights: Companies have the responsibility to respect the freedoms andrights of humans as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the GuidingPrinciples on Business and Human Rights and the core standards of the International LabourOrganization (“ILO”). Comgest expects and encourages companies to disclose an explicit policy toobserve human rights for their own operations as well as for their supply chains, particularly ifthey are in a country or sector with higher exposure to these risks. Child and forced labour areunacceptable and employees have a right to reasonable working hours and fair wages withoutany gender distinction. All companies should strive for diversity and inclusion within theirworkforce and management teams. Comgest believes that everyone is entitled to equalopportunities, the freedom of association and the protection against any form of discrimination.

– Human capital: The company’s focus on attracting, developing and retaining talent directlythrough employees, or indirectly through suppliers and the contribution of talent managementto the success of businesses.

– Employee health and safety: Good employment conditions and the promotion of employeesatisfaction is important to promote a safe and healthy workplace. Companies should activelymonitor health and safety through management systems, within their own operations and theirsupply chains. Companies are also expected to provide a robust whistleblowing mechanismwhich allows employees and third parties to report on violations of workplace rules on health,safety, employee welfare or corruption.

We take these different factors into account both in regard to a company’s current position on thesepoints as well as how they have been progressing to achieve these if not already in place. Comgest usesthe UN Global Compact to identify and assess the responsible conduct of businesses and potentialhuman rights violations. The 10 principles of the UN Global Compact as well as the OECD’s Guidelinesfor Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provide agood framework for companies to commit to and for investors to measure a company’s progress.Comgest also uses data provided by MSCI ESG Research on human rights, labour rights and humancapital scores to assess our investee companies.



iv. Remuneration of staff

Remuneration structures of investee companies should reinforce, and not undermine, sustained valuecreation. We expect companies to compensate their employees in a manner that is satisfying andreflective of their true contribution to their collective success. The issues around talent attraction andretention, as well as human dignity and paying a fair wage, are critical to the health and developmentof companies and their employees.

23 / GOOD GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES AND POLICY comgest.com



Performance-based remuneration for management should incorporate risk, including measuring risk-adjusted returns, to help ensure that no inappropriate or unintended risks are being incentivised. In themajority of cases, Comgest believes that a company should design and implement a simple andcoherent remuneration structure for all levels of management within the organisation via collaborationbetween the remuneration committee and the company’s human resources department.

Comgest takes into account multiple factors when evaluating a company's executive and employeeremuneration including consideration of company practices in relation to equity-linked instrumentplans, performance shares and the use of free/discounted shares as incentives for employees. Furtherdetails on Comgest’s policies in relation to investee company remuneration and compensation are setout in our Active Ownership Policy.



C. RESOURCES

To gather information on investee companies’ good governance practices, we principally use our ownresearch, the services of independent external service providers (including MSCI ESG Research andRepRisk) and information released by the companies themselves.

Other information sources used by our analysts may include: brokers’ reports, NGO reports andacademic research.



D. ASSESSMENT

Using the above-mentioned governance indicators, our own research and data obtained from externaldata providers, Company Analysts and ESG Analysts form their opinion as to each company's goodgovernance practices. When performing their assessment, they take into account a variety of factorssuch as the investee company’s country of origin, applicable local laws and practices as well as anycommitments taken by the investee company to improve any shortcomings. We look for the companiesto have good governance practices with limited need for improvements.



E. MONITORING AND CONTROVERSY MANAGEMENT

As an active manager, Comgest continues to research and monitor the activities and governance of ourinvestee companies on an ongoing basis. We actively review shareholder resolutions, vote at annualgeneral meetings and engage with companies. The Company Analysts and ESG Analysts track newsflows on a company to remain aware of alerts and controversies, including any controversies related togovernance.

Controversy monitoring is mainly done using the tools of our various ESG research suppliers (includingRepRisk, MSCI and Bloomberg) but we also draw on other sources such as brokers and generalist andspecialist media. When a controversy affecting a company comes to light, its content, source and thenumber of sources reporting it are reviewed by Comgest’s analysts. If the controversy is consideredboth credible and material, it is shared internally for further review. Comgest analysts may approachthe company in question and/or other affected stakeholders to assess its truth and potential impacts.The content of controversies may be shared with our clients as part of our engagement reporting.

APPENDIX II: COMGEST’S CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY



A. INTRODUCTION

Our climate is warming at unprecedented rates and rising temperatures have already led to irreversibleimpacts across ecosystems (i.e., terrestrial, freshwater, ocean) and human systems (i.e., water scarcityand food production, health and well-being, cities, settlements and infrastructure) worldwide. Everyadditional increment of global warming will increase the frequency and intensity of weather events andwill translate into additional severe risks for businesses, people, and nature. At the same time, curbingglobal greenhouse gas emissions will imply a far-reaching transition across all sectors translating intoboth transition risks and opportunities for companies.Being a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (“NZAM”) and supporting the global goal ofnet zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 across all our listed equity assets allows us to betternavigate these climate-related risks and opportunities. This commitment is linked to our overallinvestment philosophy. As long-term quality growth investors, we believe that understanding ourinvestee companies’ climate-related risks and opportunities and engaging with them on materialclimate issues strengthens our research, investment process and ability to deliver durable earnings toour clients.We recognise the climate challenge ahead is immense. We cannot divest ourselves of net zero. Successin achieving net zero portfolios relies on the world achieving a net zero economy and numerousstakeholders, including governments and companies, following through with their own commitments.Partnership – with clients, companies, industry peers – and active ownership are central to our climateapproach.



B. SCOPE

We have translated our commitment to supporting the global 2050 net zero goal into short- andmedium-term targets. These targets cover 100% of our listed equity AUM, which include companiesoperating both in material 5 and non-material sectors. These targets allow us to prioritise ourengagement resources on the highest-emitting companies facing the most stringent climate risks.Targets also help us assess companies’ climate practices, informing our research on their overallquality.



Figure 1: Asset alignment target and engagement threshold target



5 Material sectors are defined as sectors covered by NACE codes A-H and J-L.

25 / COMGEST’S CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY comgest.com



i. Target setting framework and methodology



We have selected the PAII 6 Net Zero Investment Framework (“NZIF”) to develop and set our targets.This framework has been updated in June 2024 and we have been using this updated framework (“NZIF2.0”) since December 2024.

a. Asset alignment target: key assumptions



We have considered the following elements when developing our portfolio coverage target:

– Company classification: We use the NZIF six mandatory alignment criteria to assess companies’alignment categories (see table 1).

– Data source: We use several sources to assess performance against each NZIF criteria. Theseinclude: SBTi, CDP, Climate Action 100+ and MSCI. Companies’ alignment categories arereviewed by our ESG analysts.

– Aggregation: We have aggregated the data based on the weight of companies in our overall listedequity AUM.

b. Engagement threshold target: key assumptions



We have considered the following elements when developing our engagement threshold:



6 The Paris Aligned Investment Initiative (“PAII”) is coordinated by four investor networks: IIGCC, Ceres, AIGCC and IGCC.

7 Companies operating in high impact material sectors are defined by the NZIF 2.0 methodology as companies on theClimate Action 100+ focus list, companies in high impact sectors consistent with Transition Pathway Initiative sectors;banks; real estate; and agriculture, forestry and fishing.



Criteria for all sectors



Criteria for high impact material sectors only

26 / COMGEST’S CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY comgest.com



– Data source: Carbon emissions data and Enterprise Value Including Cash (“EVIC”) data aresourced from MSCI.

– Scopes considered: All three scopes of emissions have been considered to calculate financedemissions. The data used is either reported data or estimated data. Including scope 3 data (evenif estimated) allows us to have a more comprehensive view of companies’ impact and ensurehighest emitting actors are targeted for engagement.



C. STRATEGY

Our climate strategy applies the three-pronged approach of our Responsible Investment Strategy:



i. Integration: Embedding climate in our investment process

a. Climate in our investment process



Material climate-related risks and opportunities are integrated into our analysis of companies and intoour investment decision-making process. Our Company Analysts and ESG Analysts, who are regularlytrained on climate-related topics, are responsible for identifying and assessing these material climateissues. We use both internal and external tools and data to carry out climate-focused research, notably:

– MSCI’s Climate Value-at-Risk: To perform scenario analysis, at company or portfolio level,Comgest uses MSCI’s Climate Value-at-Risk (“Climate VaR”) methodology to measure climate-related risks and opportunities within our portfolios. Based on the Task Force on Climate-RelatedFinancial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations, this forward-looking and return-basedmethodology includes both transition and physical risk assessments. It can be negative (cost) orpositive (gain) and the horizon is the next 15 years. Transition risk assessments include bothpolicy risks and technology opportunities.

– ESG dashboard: Our proprietary ESG dashboard summarises internal and external informationrelating to climate (emissions data, NZIF alignment categories, Climate VaR, etc.). This allows theInvestment team to access the latest climate-related information as input to their research.

27 / COMGEST’S CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY comgest.com



b. High impact sectors

Embedding climate into our investment process and managing climate-related risks involvesdeveloping a tailored approach for high impact sectors including oil \& gas and coal sectors. 8 Explorationor development of new oil and gas fields, as well as the use of unconventional practices, have severeenvironmental impacts and face significant climate-related risks, notably transition risks (i.e., strandedassets risks). Hence, although energy and utilities companies are usually absent from or significantlyunderweighted in our portfolios, we screen our portfolios on a quarterly basis, using MSCI data andUrgewald’s Global Oil \& Gas Exit List (“GOGEL”), to identify all companies that are exposed to thefollowing upstream, midstream and downstream activities:



Table 2: Oil \& Gas screened activities

Unconventional oil \& gasextraction

Companies involved in the extraction of unconventional oil \& gas,

where unconventional is defined as: fracking, tar sands, coal bedmethane, extra heavy oil, ultra-deepwater, and arctic drilling.



Upstream development Companies involved in conventional and unconventional oil \& gasupstream expansion projects, applying the following thresholds:

– All companies that intend to add ≥20mmboe 9 of oil \& gasresources to their production portfolio.

– All companies that spend ≥USD 10 million annually onexploration.



Midstream development Companies involved in expansion of pipelines (developing≥100km) and LNG terminal capacity (≥1Mtpa of annual capacity).



Downstream development Companies developing gas-fired power (≥ 100 MW of gas-firedpower capacity).

Captured exposure forms part of the overall ESG analysis of companies, and notably informs ouranalysts’ assessment of ESG risks. Understanding companies’ exposure to oil \& gas development is alsoconsidered to define engagement objectives, as we acknowledge the importance of dialogue to supportcompanies’ transitions over time to achieve real world decarbonisation.

Our exposure to fossil-fuel activities is disclosed on an annual basis to strengthen the transparency ofour investment approach.



ii. Active Ownership: Supporting companies on their climate transition

Active ownership is central to our climate strategy and is a key lever we use to progress against ourclimate targets.

The guiding principles of our climate engagement activities are to support companies in:

– Setting a long-term 2050 goal consistent with achieving net zero globally; and

– Developing credible transition plans that set out how companies intend to navigate the transitionto a net zero economy and deliver on their net zero pledges.

28 / COMGEST’S CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY comgest.com



We acknowledge that we cannot engage efficiently with all of our investee companies and havetherefore established the following criteria to prioritise our engagement targets:

– Percentage of financed emissions: we prioritise engagement with companies representing themost significant percentage of our financed emissions; and

– Classification category: we prioritise engagement with companies classified as “not aligned”,“committed to aligning” and “aligning”.

Our climate engagement approach includes both direct dialogue with companies as well ascollaborative engagement and aligns with specific guidelines on climate-related resolutions (i.e., wegenerally vote in favour of resolutions requesting companies to disclose climate-related informationand set science-based targets, etc.). 10

Our engagement activities are tailored to each companies’ specific context, but are grounded inassessing robustness of climate transition plans, using for instance the Institutional Investor Group onClimate Change (“IIGCC”) “Investor Expectations of Corporate Transition Plans” five components:1. Comprehensive, aligned emissions targets;2. A credible strategy to deliver those targets;3. Demonstrable engagement commitments to support the achievement of targets;4. The contribution to climate solutions 11; and5. Supporting emissions and accounting disclosures.

We also use our voting rights actively to influence better outcomes on climate-related topics. Weencourage companies to implement a “say on climate” and put forward advisory resolutions on theirclimate action plans, decarbonisation targets and progress on emissions reduction at their AGMs. Wegenerally support these advisory resolutions where we have deemed a company’s climate targets andstrategy to be aligned with our own climate commitment.



iii. Partnership: Working alongside clients and peers to advance climate action



Reaching net zero implies a systemic transition of the economy. Therefore, partnership with industrypeers to share knowledge and best practices, as well as to advance engagement with companies, whereapplicable, is important. We also work with data providers, where relevant, to contribute toenhancement and availability of climate data. Key initiatives we have joined to partner on knowledgeexchange include: the NZAM and the IIGCC. We also aim to provide our clients with climate-relatedinformation on their investments and to help them progress against their own climate targets.



D. OVERSIGHT

The Sustainability Committee oversees the annual review and approval of this Climate Change Policy(“Policy”) by the relevant entities and boards. This Policy may be reviewed more frequently as required.The Committee also oversees the Policy’s implementation which is carried out by the investment teamstogether with dedicated ESG resources.



E. REPORTING

Disclosures on climate metrics and targets, aligned with TCFD recommendations, are included in ourPRI assessment reports as well as in our Annual Sustainability Report. The Annual Sustainability Reportcovers metrics and targets at the Group level, as well as metrics and targets for our main investmentstrategies. We also measure and report on our climate impacts and related mitigation actions throughour Annual Statements of Principal Adverse Impacts of Investment Decisions on Sustainability Factors(PAI Statements). These reports are available on our website.



10 More details on our engagement approach can be found in our Active Ownership Policy.11 We recognise that not all companies are positioned to provide climate solutions. This component is therefore notapplicable to all our investee companies.

29 / COMGEST’S POLICY ON NATURE AND DEFORESTATION comgest.com



APPENDIX III: COMGEST’S POLICY ON NATURE ANDDEFORESTATION



A. INTRODUCTION

This policy sets out our strategy for identifying and addressing nature-related risks across our investeecompanies and our thematic focus on deforestation.

The term nature represents the global natural ecosystem in its entirety and encompasses bothbiodiversity and ecosystem services.



– Biodiversity as defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity relates to the diversity ofspecies as well as diversity within species, diversity of ecosystems, and the interactions betweenthem. Biodiversity is part of ecosystems and supports ecosystem services. The loss of biodiversityundermines the ability of nature to provide ecosystem services on which the society andbusinesses rely.

– Ecosystem services are positive benefits that wildlife or ecosystems provide to people. Theseecosystem services include provisioning services (e.g., food, raw materials, fresh water,pollination), regulating services (e.g., climate regulation, erosion and flood control) and culturalservices (e.g., recreation and tourism). The importance of these ecosystem services is such thathuman society and the global economy could not exist without them.

Investee companies may have dependencies and/or impacts on nature:

– A dependency assessment aims to determine how much a company depends on ecosystemservices. This involves understanding the degree of dependency of an investee company,considering whether the dependency is direct or along the value chain. By assessing the degree ofdependency of our investee companies on ecosystem services we can assess to what extent ourinvestee companies run a financial risk when the provision of ecosystem services is affected.

– An impact assessment aims to determine a company’s impact on nature. This involvesunderstanding the negative contribution of an investee company to changes to nature from itsown operations or from its supply chain. According to the Intergovernmental Science-PolicyPlatform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (“IPBES”) the five main drivers of biodiversityloss are changes in land (e.g., deforestation) and sea use, direct exploitation of resources, climatechange, pollution, and invasive species.

Nature-related risks are risks stemming from investee companies’ dependencies and impacts on nature.As with climate-related risks, nature-related risks are characterised as either physical or transitionrisks:

– Physical risks arise due to the materialisation of damage to nature and the decline in the state ofnature disrupting the ecosystem services on which an investee company depends (e.g., lack ofraw materials for pharmaceutical production or loss of revenues because of reduced soilproductivity).

– Transition risks arise from changes in policy, new technologies, legal requirements, consumerpreferences, etc.It is therefore essential for Comgest to understand the extent to which the risks resulting from natureloss will lead to financial risks and over what timescale, and how these risks contribute to the total riskprofile of our investee companies and the portfolios we manage. Our assessment will enable us toidentify and prioritise companies most exposed to nature-related risks.



B. SCOPE

This policy applies to all listed companies that we invest in, worldwide.

30 / COMGEST’S POLICY ON NATURE AND DEFORESTATION comgest.com



C. STRATEGY

Our biodiversity strategy applies the three-pronged approach of our Responsible Investment Strategy:



i. Integration



a. Embedding the assessment of nature-related risk within the investment process



As part of the ESG integration process, nature related-risks and opportunities are assessed through acombination of Company and ESG Analyst research. Nature-related metrics are incorporated into ourESG dashboard and are factors our ESG and Company analysts consider when performing sustainabilityrisk and principal adverse impact assessments of investee companies. All companies are also assessedfor controversies related to impacts on nature using third-party data. Our findings are summarised inour proprietary ESG assessments.

Our assessment of the dependency on ecosystem services will cover direct operations and ourassessment of impacts on nature will cover both direct operations and those of its upstream suppliers.



1\. Identification of high-risk companies

– Using data from ENCORE 12, we identify economic activities that have high dependency onecosystem services. Given their potential very high dependence on ecosystem services,companies mapped to these economic activities could face an important financial risk if theecosystem service(s) they rely on stopped or declined. Therefore, investee companies mapped tothese economic activities will be classified as high-risk for nature dependency.

– Using data from ENCORE, we identify economic activities that have very high impact on nature,specifically on the main drivers of biodiversity loss (i.e., changes in land and sea use, directexploitation of resources, climate change, pollution, and invasive species). Given their potentiallyvery high impact on nature, companies mapped to these economic activities could face animportant financial risk if their impact led to regulatory fines, reputational risk or legal risk.Therefore, companies mapped to these economic activities will be classified as high-risk fornature impact.



12 Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure

31 / COMGEST’S POLICY ON NATURE AND DEFORESTATION comgest.com



2\. Identifying priority companies



Companies that are classified as high-risk will be prioritised for an in-depth assessment, which willinclude:

– The extent of the company’s impact or dependency on nature;

– Measures being taken by the company to mitigate impact or dependency (preservation,restoration, education of suppliers, procurement guidelines, risk management practices toaddress biodiversity dependence and impacts, etc.); and

– Targets and timeline set to reduce adverse impacts.If the companies have not adopted any mitigation measures, they will be prioritised for engagement.



b. Actions taken to align with nature-related goals and targets

Ongoing rapid declines in biodiversity and ecosystem services mean that the goals set in theConvention of Biological Diversity 13 for conserving and sustainably using nature will not be achievedbased on current trajectories. Conscious of this risk, the UN Biodiversity conference COP15 in Montréalestablished the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The 23 targets in the Frameworkinclude targets to reduce threats to biodiversity (e.g., bringing loss of high biodiversity areas "close tozero" by 2030, reducing pollution risks by 2030, minimising the impact of climate change and oceanacidification on biodiversity) and targets to encourage the sustainable use of biodiversity (e.g., asubstantial increase of the application of biodiversity friendly practices, using nature-based solutionsand ecosystem-based approaches). Target 15 of the COP15 emphasises the need for financialinstitutions to monitor, assess, and transparently disclose their risks, dependencies and impacts onbiodiversity.



c. Measuring our investee companies’ alignment with nature-related goals

We measure the alignment of our investee companies with nature-related goals and targets by using anenvironmental footprint developed by Trucost which provides an indicative assessment of investeecompanies’ negative environmental impact through the assessment of key environmental pressures(i.e., GHG, water, waste, soil and water pollutants, air pollutants, and the use of natural resources). Theimpact assessment takes into account a company’s own business activities and those of its upstreamsuppliers. The results obtained allow us to better understand the overall impact of our investmentstrategy and investment decision-making on nature.



d. Comgest’s targets

In line with target 15 of the COP15, we monitor, assess, and intend to disclose nature-related risks,dependencies and impacts. We encourage investee companies to assess their dependencies andimpacts on nature and to publicly disclose their actions.

We also expect our high-risk portfolio companies (very high dependency and/or very high impact) toreduce negative outcomes over time. We will be setting initial engagement targets for these high-riskcompanies to ensure they are subject to either individual or collaborative engagement. As part of thisengagement, we will request information on the investee companies’ assessment of impact and/ordependency, board and management oversight and policies implemented to address nature-relatedrisks.

ii. Thematic focus: Deforestation

a. Why a focus on deforestation?



Deforestation and natural ecosystem conversion are key drivers of biodiversity loss, climate change andsevere human rights violations of indigenous peoples and local communities. Halting deforestationplays a key role in reducing such impacts and risks for businesses, people and nature.

Agricultural commodity sourcing for palm oil, soy, beef, leather, timber, and pulp \& paper is by far thelargest cause of deforestation and conversion. This means reducing agricultural commodity-drivendeforestation for these commodities has the potential to make a large and rapid positive impact on theclimate and nature risks that we face as investors.

In order to take an active approach to addressing this important topic, we became a signatory to theFinancial Sector Commitment Letter on Eliminating Commodity-Driven Deforestation launched at theCOP26 in Glasgow in November 2021. Investors that have signed up to this commitment, includingComgest, agree to use their best efforts to eliminate agricultural commodity-driven deforestation linkedto key forest risk commodities – palm oil, soy, beef, leather, timber, and pulp \& paper – from theirinvestment and lending portfolios by 2025. Comgest will report on its progress in reaching the differentmilestones set towards eliminate commodity-driven deforestation in our investments.



b. Embedding the assessment of deforestation-related risk within the investment process

Not all sectors and geographical areas are concerned in the same way or to the same degree, and not allinvestee companies in our portfolios are involved in the production, trade, use or financing of forest-risk commodities which include palm oil, soy, beef, leather, timber, and pulp \& paper.



– Company level deforestation risk assessmentUsing data from external providers (such as Forest 500) Comgest screens its investee companies toidentify those most exposed to deforestation-related risks and assesses how they are mitigating theserisks.



Forest 500 covers 350 companies and 150 financial institutions who are regarded as the mostinfluential companies in the deforestation-related commodity supply chains. Companies are annuallyassessed on a broad range of indicators related to deforestation and human rights. The review of thereport enables us to perform a high-level risk assessment and identify companies that are mostexposed to deforestation risk and to identify companies that should be prioritised for engagement. Byidentifying companies with low scores in the Forest 500 report we can identify gaps in their approachon deforestation and human rights and engage with the companies on how to improve their approachto align with best practice.

Information obtained from external providers will be factors that our ESG and Company Analysts takeinto account when performing sustainability risk and principal adverse impact assessments for investeecompanies that are identified as high-risk in respect of deforestation-related risks. The ESG andCompany Analysts will review metrics including Forest 500 and CDP scores and assess a company’stransparency in reporting progress against their commitments. Where available, analysts will alsoreview a company’s commitments on deforestation and to a traceable supply chain, their deforestation-related risk assessments, any human rights abuses associated with deforestation. Our analysts’ findingswill be incorporated in the overarching investee company’s ESG Assessment and will help the ESG andCompany analysts determine engagement priorities for companies with heightened deforestation-related risks.



– Overall assessment of Comgest’s exposure to deforestation-related risksBy carrying out the deforestation-related risk assessment at investee company level, Comgest canassess and report on its overall exposure to deforestation-related risk and identify opportunities to drivechange through company engagement and advocacy initiatives.

iii. Active Ownership



As long-term shareholders, we are in a position to encourage and support improvements on nature-related issues by our investee companies. Issues which could materially affect our portfolio companiesmay lead to targeted voting and engagement activity. We combine several active approaches to achievethis. Please refer to our Active Ownership Policy for further information.



a. Individual company engagement

We prefer direct dialogue to address issues with our companies. This enables us to better understandeach company’s position, to encourage improvement and to monitor progress.

We may engage with companies on broader biodiversity topics (e.g., avoiding, or minimisingbiodiversity impact) or engage with companies on specific nature-related themes such as deforestation,plastic pollution or chemical waste.

Our research findings help the ESG Analysts and Company Analysts set engagement priorities withhigh-risk companies that have either high impact or high dependency on nature.

Our dialogue with these companies allows us to both better understand how nature-related risks aremanaged, and assess the various mitigation actions companies have implemented or plan toimplement.

Our Company Analysts and ESG Analysts expect all high-risk companies to demonstrate anunderstanding of their exposure to nature-related risks, including through their supply chain, and theirintention to reduce them. Our analysts may also request that companies implement further riskmitigation actions and track progress on these recommendations. Companies that do not yet complywith these expectations will remain targeted for engagement.

We also encourage high-risk companies to apply or participate in credible standards and certificationsschemes such the Roundtable on Responsible Soy (“RTRS”), Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) or theRoundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (“RSPO”) which help demonstrate a company’s willingness to adoptbest industry practices.



b. Collaborative engagement

Engaging alongside other investors enables us to strengthen our voice when engaging with companies.

Collaborative engagement can achieve powerful results, particularly with companies that are notresponsive to individual engagement. We currently take part in several collaborative initiatives linkedto nature, as listed on our website.



c. Voting

We use our voting rights actively to influence better outcomes on nature-related topics. We typicallysupport resolutions linked to relevant positive impacts on nature and vote against resolutions whichwould have detrimental consequences on nature.



d. Partnership

Joining forces with other like-minded investors, clients and industry participants can be an importanttool for addressing biodiversity-related risks. We achieve this by:



– Participating in a variety of industry initiatives. This includes industry events, workshops andmeetings dedicated to sharing our views and knowledge with others;

– Engaging with our investors on this topic through dedicated meetings, events and knowledgesharing initiatives; and

– Disclosing our activities transparently (see section E. Reporting).

35 / COMGEST’S HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY comgest.com



APPENDIX IV: COMGEST’S HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY



INTRODUCTION

This Human Rights Policy (“Policy”) sets out our strategy for identifying and addressing human rightsrisks and impacts across our investee companies. As a quality growth investor, Comgest pays carefulattention to the social risk profile of companies. The costs associated with human rights violations canbe material to a company’s business. The abuse of human rights can present financial, regulatory,reputational, legal and societal risks. There are many examples of human rights incidents negativelyimpacting share prices. These include product safety issues, disputes over wages and workingconditions, data privacy breaches, employee discrimination, severe workplace accidents, etc.

We use the following international standards to assess the responsible conduct of businesses andidentify potential human rights violations and related risks: the principles of the United Nations GlobalCompact (“UNGC”), the United Nations Guiding Principles (“UNGPs”), as well as the conventions of theInternational Labour Organization (“ILO”) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (“OECD”) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.



SCOPE

This Policy applies to all listed companies that we invest in, worldwide.



STRATEGY

Our human rights strategy applies the three-pronged approach of our Responsible Investment Strategy:



i. Integrate: embedding human rights within the investment process



As part of our investment research process, we aim to identify and assess all potential material humanrights issues. These material issues and associated risks are notably outlined within Comgest’sproprietary ESG Assessments.



a. Identifying human rights issues

Human rights issues that we consider throughout the investment process may include, but are notlimited to:

– Labour practices and working conditions: modern slavery, forced or trafficked labour, childlabour, freedom of movement, debt bondage, collective bargaining and recognition of tradeunions, freedom of expression and association, workplace health and safety, access to trainingand skills. This includes direct employees as well as contractors and sub-contractors within thesupply chain;

36 / COMGEST’S HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY comgest.com



– Standard of living: fair wages, working hours, fair treatment and training, standard of livingstatus, equal opportunities for promotion;

– Affordability and access: unethical distribution of products and services, price discrimination;

– Product safety: safety standards and certifications, product labelling and marketing, training;

– Data privacy and security: fraud, hacking, misuse or loss of confidential data;

– Diversity, equity and inclusion (DE\&I): gender diversity and pay gap, DE\&I practices, harassmentand discrimination; and

– Respect for local communities including indigenous peoples’ rights: uncontrolled side effectsbusiness operations to people, their standard of living and their environments, forceddisplacement, lack of effective security, strain on infrastructure and public services, land rightsincluding lack of respect for ancestral land and cultural heritage.A company’s industry, geographic or business focus can help to identify potential human rights risks.For example:

– Textiles companies, particularly those with global supply chains, may be more prone to risksincluding migrant labour working conditions, fair wages, child labour and modern slavery;

– Technology, communication services, financials and payments companies may be more prone toissues surrounding data privacy and security;

– Pharmaceutical companies may be more prone to issues surrounding product safety, productaccess and affordability;

– Chemicals companies may be more prone to occupational health and safety issues foremployees, product safety issues for consumers and impact to local communities due to thehandling and use of hazardous substances;

– Companies with operations or supply chains in lower-cost frontier and emerging markets may besubject to risks concerning employees’ and contractors’ level of wages, working conditions andlocal labour practices;

– High growth companies with a strong performance culture may be prone to increased risk ofworkplace health and safety issues (notably mental health) as well as harassment anddiscrimination.

While an inherent exposure analysis based on sector, business activities and geography is a goodstarting point for identifying human rights risks, our proprietary research process is adapted to eachcompany and each company is assessed according to its unique circumstances. Our Investment team isresponsible for assessing human rights issues for each portfolio company, with a focus on companiesexposed to material human rights risks. Material risks and opportunities, where identified, aresummarised within each ESG Assessment.

Our analysis may include the following elements:

– Assessment of a company’s reporting and information gathered throughout our research andinteraction with company representatives. We look for:

• Public commitments, for example the endorsement of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights, identifying salient human rights issues as defined by the UN Guiding Principles onBusiness and Human Rights, signatory status of the UN Global Compact;

• Human rights due diligence system to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for adversehuman rights impacts;

• Human rights policy: topics may be embedded in other policies for example, a code ofconduct, sustainability/corporate social responsibility policy, sector-specific policy, andpolicies relating to recruitment, employment, health and safety or community relations. Welook to see evidence of policy implementation including training and monitoring practices.

– Review of independent industry and company data available through sources such as Know theChain, World Benchmark Alliance and the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre;

– Use of third-party data such as MSCI and RepRisk to assess:

• Alignment with the UNGC, the UNGPs and the ILO fundamental principles (existence of duediligence policies on labour issues);

• Controversies: we analyse negative human rights-related company events and assess theeffectiveness of a company’s response to these events (transparency, action, provision ofaccess to remedy)

– We intensify our research on any high-risk areas identified as part of the assessment process.



b. Exclusions

Comgest identifies and excludes companies involved in severe violations using the followinginternational standards :

– United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”) Principles

– The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) Guidelines forMultinational Enterprises

– International Labor Organization (“ILO”) standards

– United Nations Guiding Principles (“UNGPs”)Please refer to the Group Exclusion Policy (Appendix V) for further details.

For our Plus Strategies additional exclusion criteria, please refer to the Comgest Plus Exclusion Policy.



ii. Active Ownership



As long-term shareholders, we are in a position to encourage our investee companies to improve theirhuman rights practices and uphold human rights standards. Issues which could materially affect ourportfolio companies may lead to targeted voting and engagement activity. We combine several activeapproaches to achieve this:



Individual company engagement

We prefer direct dialogue to address issues with our companies. Direct communication allows us togain a deeper and more nuanced understanding of a company’s position, which helps us encourageimprovement and monitor progress.

As well as encouraging the improvement of everyday work practices for companies exposed tosignificant risks, we push for companies to disclose their human rights commitments by publishingformal policies. We also recommend that companies adopt compliance with credible standards,certifications, partnerships, and initiatives focused on material human rights topics. This could include,for example, certifications regarding workplace safety standards and product safety.



Collaborative engagement

Joining forces with likeminded investors and other stakeholders can be a powerful way to achieveresults, particularly with companies that are not responsive to individual engagement. We currentlytake part in several collaborative initiatives linked to human rights initiatives, as listed on our website.

We may also choose to engage at industry level on systemic human rights issues. Engaging alongsideother investors typically enables us to strengthen our voice when communicating our opinions topolicymakers and other key industry participants.



Voting

We support relevant positive human rights-related resolutions and vote against resolutions whichwould lead to negative impacts on human rights. Please refer to our Active Ownership Policy for furtherinformation.



iii. Partnership



Partnering with investors, clients and industry participants can be an important tool for addressinghuman rights issues. We achieve this by:

– Participating in a variety of industry initiatives. This includes industry events, workshops andmeetings dedicated to sharing our views and knowledge with others;

– Working alongside our clients on this topic through dedicated meetings, events and knowledgesharing initiatives; and

– Disclosing our activities transparently (refer section E. Reporting).

39 / COMGEST GROUP EXCLUSION POLICY comgest.com



APPENDIX V: COMGEST GROUP EXCLUSION POLICY



A. INTRODUCTION

As a quality growth investor, we invest and partner with companies that we believe can sustaininvestment returns over the long term. Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors areimportant drivers of investment returns from both an opportunity and a risk mitigation perspective.

We believe that value creation is enhanced when companies deliver social utility while limiting theirnegative impacts on the environment and society. These investment beliefs lead us to integrate ESGconsiderations throughout our investment process and implement the exclusion criteria defined in thisComgest Group Exclusion Policy (“Policy”).

Our investment selection process makes it unlikely that companies with substantial ESG risks willsatisfy the required standards of quality, visibility and sustainability that we seek in quality growthcompanies. Nevertheless, for certain activities where ESG risks and impacts tend to be more significantor are subject to regulatory restrictions, Comgest applies and implements targeted exclusion criteria.This Policy defines these criteria as well as outlines how these criteria are managed and overseen.

Our exclusion criteria is summarised in Table 1 below, with more detailed information in sections C, Dand E.

c. Threshold management and data sources

The thresholds defined above regarding electricity production will be progressively lowered to reach acoal phase-out by 2030 for Developed Markets and 2040 for Emerging Markets. To implement our coalexit policy, Comgest uses MSCI data and Urgewald’s Global Coal Exit List (“GCEL”). Based on dataobtained from these providers, Comgest draws up an exclusion list. This list is updated once a year fordata extracted from the GCEL and quarterly for data extracted from MSCI.

Comgest may decide to exempt certain companies from the exclusion list if they make crediblecommitments to reduce their exposure to coal within a set timeframe. Consideration for exemptionfrom the policy will be submitted for approval to the Sustainability Committee. The approval processfor exemption includes an assessment of both quantitative and qualitative criteria (e.g., the company’sclimate strategy and their coal exit plan as well as the degree of prioritisation given to a lower-carbonbusiness model by management, etc.).



NORM-BASED EXCLUSIONS

Companies of all sectors and in all countries can profoundly impact the human rights of employees,consumers, and communities. These impacts may be positive, such as increasing access to employmentor improving public services, or negative, such as polluting the environment, underpaying workers, orevicting communities.
