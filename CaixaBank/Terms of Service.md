1. Introduction



1.1 Background



CaixaBank, S.A. (hereinafter “CaixaBank” or “the Entity”) and the other subsidiaries (hereinafter, jointly with

CaixaBank, the "CaixaBank Group" or “the Group”) integrate environmental, social and governance

(hereinafter, “ESG”) criteria1 into their business decisions with the aim of mitigating risks and supporting

those projects that are consistent with their corporate values.

This update to the Policy to which these Principles relate reflects society's increased awareness of and

concern for the sustainability of the economic model and of long-term growth, which is resulting in

constantly changing regulations and expectations in this area, both general and specific to the financial

sector's potential contribution to mitigate any adverse effects.

Financial institutions are viewed as having a potentially significant impact on helping to achieve the

Sustainable Development Goals (“SDG”), insofar as some sectors that they finance, investin or provide their

services to are involved in controversy and will have to deal with multiple restrictions, challenges and

transformations to the business models and technologies in coming years, e ither to adjust to their

consumers' preferences or due to regulatory pressure.

Because of this, CaixaBank deems it essential to identify, measure, assess, manage, control, mitigate and

report on the ESG risks associated with the Group's activity.



It also adds other positions that have resulted from comparing the best international practices and the

growing expectations of various stakeholders that are relevant to the Group.

They remain as independent documents, but related to the Policy referred to by the se Principles, the

“Operating principles in the area of sustainability”, which lay out the internal strategy that will be followed

with various stakeholders in this field2, as well as “Human Rights Principles” and the “Statement on Climate

Change” and the "Nature Declaration".



1 Hereinafter, ESG risks will be referred to as equivalent to sustainability risks.

2 The "sustainability-ESG" aspect that is regulated in the Policy referred to by these Principles is our customers' compliance with ESG aspects and the potential indirect impacts this

could have on the Group.

1.2 Scope



The risks that are governed, managed and controlled by the Policy referred to by these Principles are as

follows, denoted as "ESG" or "sustainability" risks indicated below: These risks are explained in a cross-

cutting manner in the Corporate Risk catalogue, as they affect different taxonomy risks, such as, for

example, credit risk, legal and regulatory risk, reputational risk and other operating risks:

• The environmental risks (“E)” are those related to legal entities that could be potentially affected by, or

contribute to, the negative impacts of environmental trends, such as climate change (including but not

limited to GHG emissions) and other methods of environmental degradation (such as air and water

pollution, a shortage of fresh water, soil pollution, the loss of biodiversity and deforestation); It also

includes corrective actions intended to prevent or mitigate their occurrence.

Risks related to nature pose potential threats to an organisation given their reliance on and impact on

the nature. In addition, risks associated with climate change are those linked to the global warming

caused by greenhouse gas emissions. These types of risks can be divided into two categories:

• Physical, related to meteorological (for example, hurricanes or storms), geological

(earthquakes) events or to the degradation of or changes in the balance of ecosystems (such

as rising sea levels, desertification or changes in soil quality), whether:

 Acute, due to the higher likelihood and impact of extreme natural events.



 Chronic, associated with permanent changes in the environment.

In any case, the physical risks can entail damages to the assets of companies, disruptions

in the supply chain or increase the expenses needed to deal with them.

• Transitional, resulting from an imbalance between an organisation's strategy and

management and developments that aim to stop or reverse the damage to nature; as well

as when and how fast we will be able to transition to an economy that i s less carbon

dependent, which will depend on political/legal, technological, market and reputational

factors.

• The social risks (“S”) measure potential indirectadverse impacts on society associated with legal entities

that do not respect human rights or the health and safety of their employees or workers in the value

chain. CaixaBank considers adverse impacts related to the following as particularly important: forced

labour, child labour, occupational health and safety, the right to receive a decent wage, community

problems related to land and/or resettlement (involuntary), the rights of the indigenous peoples and

community health and security.

• Governance ("G") risks result from a negative impact due to weaknesses associated with legal entities,

such as transparency, market behaviour, anti-corruption policies, compliance with tax obligations and

other behaviours that are deemed ethical by the relevant stakeholders.

The Policy to which these Principles refer applies to companies:

• With which the Group is considering establishing commercial relations, enter into new credit or

guarantee operations or renew/renegotiate existing ones, as well as other financing transactions.

• In which the Group invests of its own accord in fixed-income and variable-yield securities.

• Group companies managed through a portfolio in stock investments.

This document, therefore, does not cover the relationship with internal vendors or with their vendors. In

this case, the ESG risk analysis is covered through the purchase certification process, which, within the

scope of CaixaBank and the Group companies that share the same purchasing management model,

includes the "Code of Conduct of Vendors" approved by the Company's Management Board.



1.3 Objective



The purpose of the Policy referred to by these Principles is to establish the principles, premises and

mechanisms to ensure that the ESG risks associated with customers and proprietary investments are

governed, managed and controlled such that they comply with the expectations of the Group's

stakeholders while enabling the Group to take advantage of business opportunities and to guide the

Group's customers through the transformation they are undergoing and will undergo in coming years.

Thus, the Policy referred to by these Principles lays out a framework of general principles that must

underpin all the actions that are related to or have a significant impact on these risks. It also provides a

basic governance framework to authorise, manage, report and disclose these actions. The management

of ESG risks constitutes one of the main areas of action of the sustainability strategy defined at CaixaBank.

2. Scope of application



The Policy referred to by these Principles is corporate in scope, meaning it applies both to CaixaBank, S.A.

and to those subsidiaries that engage in activities that are exposed to ESG risks. The governance bodies of

these companies will make the decisions necessary to integrate the provisions of this Policy. They will apply

the principle of proportionality to adapt the governance framework to the idiosyncrasy of their structure

of governance bodies, committees and departments, and their principles of action, methodologies, and

processes to the contents of this document.

This integration may entail, among others decisions, the approval of an internal policy by the Group

company. This approval will be necessary in those Group companies that need to adapt the contents

herein to their own specific situation, whether in terms of the subject matter, the jurisdiction or the

relevance of the risk in the Group company. The governing bodies of the Group companies shall

abide by this corporate Policy when the operational principles of the corporate Policy are applicable

but the Group company does not have its own policy, and the corporate Policy lays out principles,

obligations and activities that must be carried out directly by the Group company. In those cases in

which the Group company's risk control and management activities are done directly by CaixaBank,

either due to the materiality of the risk in the Group company or for reasons of efficiency or because

the Group company has externalised to CaixaBank the operational management of that risk, the

governing bodies of the affected Group companies will acknowledge the existence of this corporate

Policy and of its application to said Group companies.

In any case, CaixaBank's Sustainability Committee, given its corporate character, will ensure that

these policies are integrated by the Group companies in a proportionate manner, that any internal

policies approved by the Group companies are consistent with the corporate policy, and that all the

policies are consistent throughout the CaixaBank Group.

Lastly, the Policy to which these Principles refer is not only corporate in scope, but is considered an

individual policy of CaixaBank, the parent company of the CaixaBank Group.

4. Corporate strategy on ESG risks



The strategy that will govern the activity of the CaixaBank Group for controlling and managing ESG risks

involving customers and proprietary investments considers the following main areas of action:

Promote sustainable businesses that generate production with a positive environmental and

climate impact and support the transition toward more sustainable business models.

Integrate social and environmental risks into decision-making and avoid financing or investing

in those companies or projects that involve serious human rights or labour offences, or that have a

negative environmental impact without sufficient mitigation measures or adequate transition

measures being put in place.

Manage thesocial, environmental andgovernancerisks and integrate the analysis of these risks

into the customer admission processes, in the products and services provided to customers,

proprietary investments and management of stock portfolios.

Work to understand the impacts on human rights derived from its activity and thus prevent

and avoid contributing to any potential negative impacts, or to mitigate them as much as possible

otherwise.

Act in accordance with the public commitments made, such as the "Sustainability Principles",

the “Statement on climate change”, the "Nature Declaration", the “Principles on human rights” and

“Principles of Responsible Banking", as well as with any other initiative or commitment in the field of

ESG that is undertaken, always subject to proper compliance with its requirements.

Support the transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. To do so, it will guide its

customers in the decarbonisation of their activities by helping them to develop and implement

solutions and technologies that accelerate the transition to a net-zero carbon emissions economy.

It will also impose restrictions on financing heavily polluting sectors,forcing them to abide by certain

conditions, such as establishing specific and achievable decarbonisation targets. Exceptionally, it

may also be allowed to finance activities in sectors in certain countries where the energy transition

may be particularly complex or have a significant adverse social impact.

Promote transparency by properly reporting to markets on the management and control of ESG

risks, in compliance with the applicable laws and best practices.

5. Governance framework



The pillars that support the framework for managing ESG risks at the CaixaBank Group are:

• Compliance with the principles contained in the Policy to which these Principlesrefer by the companies

in the CaixaBank Group within their area of applicability.

• Corporate supervision by the parent company.

• Alignment of strategies among the Group companies and, in turn, alignment with best practices,

supervisory expectations and current regulations.

• Maximum involvement of the governance bodies and management of the Group companies.

• Internal control framework based on the Three Lines of Defence model, which guarantees strict

segregation of duties and the existence of multiple independent control layers.

• Incorporation into the current processes for onboarding customers, issuing financing and proprietary

investments, as well as enforcing the governance that applies thereto in order to encourage greater

and better integration of ESG in decision-making and minimise redundant processes, which could

hamper commercial or investing activities.



The Board of Directors of CaixaBank is responsible for implementing a risk governance framework that

addresses the Group's risk propensity. This includes the adoption of a solid and diligent risk culture, setting

a risk appetite in accordance with the Risk Appetite Framework(RAF) and defining responsibilities for taking,

managing and controlling risks.

The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for establishing the Group's general strategies and policies,

and is tasked with approving these Principles - after review by the Risks and Appointments and

Sustainability Committees - and enforcing their provisions.

6. ESG risk management framework



6.1 General lines of action



The framework for managing ESG risks that is implemented pursuant to the Policy to whichthese Principles

refer must include at least the following areas of action:



1. Define and manage a plan for managing ESG risks that is consistent with the Group's strategy.

2. Define and manage the implementation of a framework for onboarding, monitoring and mitigation

policies that allow maintaining a risk profile that is consistent with said strategy.

3. Develop the ESG risk analysis tools needed for decision-making in the customer onboarding and

risk concession processes, whether in corporate or project formats.

4. Monitor the activities and operations with a potential significant impact on ESG risks.

5. Incentivise practices to mitigate the ESG risks assumed in the portfolios as part of the scope of

applicability of the Policy to which these Principles refer or other types of actions (such as, for

example, the issuance of green and social bonds).

6. Promote the development of systems for identifying operations and measuring exposure to ESG

risks that reflect changes in regulations, in society's sensitivity to these risks and in best market

practices.

7. Assign personnel withinthe existing organisational structure to manage ESG risks, with the necessary

separation of duties to ensure independence between the departments responsible for the

processes of defining the strategy, analysing and approving operations, and monitoring and

controlling said risks.

8. Establish a system of authority for onboarding ESG risks that allows said risks to be incorporated

quickly but robustly into normal decision-making processes, consistent with the scope of this

document.

As concerns the applicable criteria for holding the risk levels to within the RAF, the Poli cy to which these

Principles refer states:

General action criteria to exclude or limit the acceptance of exposure to ESG risks. These are

company-wide criteria that apply to all customers (legal entities) as indicated in the scope of the

Policy to which the bank provides or may provide financial services or products, or in which it may

invest directly.

Specific action criteria to exclude or limit the acceptance of exposures to certain sectors

(hereinafter, "sector-specific") and to activities that have a particular impact on the environment or

society, occasionally with special sensitivity to certain protected ecosystems, sites or populations.

© CaixaBank, S.A. 2024\. Regulatory compliance 11



In each section, guidelines as set out under "aspects considered in the customer evaluation" for the

evaluation of customers in each area, considered whenever applicable and according to expert criteria to

determine whether they satisfy the provisions of this Policy. Furthermore, each of these sections, under

"exclusions and restrictions" establishes the activities or customers that are incompatible with CaixaBank ́s

activities and that are considered as not complying with this Policy, unless explicitly indi cated otherwise.

Lastly, the analysis required by the implementationof the Policy to which these Principles refer will generally

apply to customers based on the corporate group to which they belong, unless there is a lower level that

can provide a more accurate representation of the level of ESG risk assumed. Based on the materiality of

the ESG impact and the risk appetite, the Policy to which these Principles refer allows for the exclusion of

certain types of companies from the customer base (i.e. it does not provide products or services and it

does not invest in them), and in other cases it specifies financing and investment restrictions.

To implement the Policy to which these Principles refer, the Sustainability and Global Risk committees must

establish an application procedure for the proper application of the criteria set out in the Policy.



6.2 Key policy compliance processes



In order to enforce this Policy, a methodology will be applied to evaluate ESG risks, which will be

implemented in the relevant onboarding processes applicable to the perimeter described in this Policy.



6.2.1. Methodology for evaluating and sanctioning ESG risks when

evaluating customers and financing operations



Determination of the ESG risk level



As with other risks that affect CaixaBank, the need to evaluate the ESG risks of customers, operations and

assets will be initiated by assessing the inherentrisk, whichwill be estimated based on certaincharacteristics,

such as the activity code (CNAE) that is most representative of the Group's activity,the countryof residence

when it poses a high ESG risk or the intended use of the funds.

Process for evaluating ESG risks



The analysis of ESG risks forms part of the customer onboarding process (ESG onboarding) and the

financing acceptance process; for all customers and transactions subject to the scope of this Policy.

a. As part of the customer onboarding process, an ESG risk analysis is performed on customers

to determine their compliance or non-compliance with the criteria set out in this Policy on

Human Rights and Health and Safety Policies, with a particular focus on defence.

© CaixaBank, S.A. 2024\. Regulatory compliance 12



b. As part of the financing operation acceptance process, an analysis is performed of ESG risks

associated with the customer's activity, which complements the analysis performed as part of

the customer onboarding process and which seeks to ensure compliance with the Policy. If the

financing is for specificprojects, an evaluation will be performed depending on the type of asset

to be financed.

As part of the analysis, consideration is given to environmental, social and governance risk, including

aspects related to the company's ESG control framework and the existence or otherwise of ESG

controversies3 , the decarbonisationstrategy,and compliance with the Equator Principles, where applicable.

In other words, a holistic due diligence analysis of customers from an ESG perspective.

For all customers and projects analysed,an assessment is performed as to whether there are environmental

mitigation actions to minimise or mitigate the environmental and social impacts caused by activities.

To complete this analysis, information is consulted via public sources and external suppliers of ESG

information, in particular for the information on controversies in the criteria excluded under this Policy. A

Controversies Working Group has also been set up, consisting of ESG experts and the Reputational Risk

Advice Service.

CaixaBank spares no efforts when it comes to obtaining sustainability information on its customers and

uses information provided by external suppliers of ESG information as a basis for the decision -making

process. However, CaixaBank continues to rely on the availability and reporting of up-to-date and high-

quality information.

If, during the analysis process, insufficient evidence is found to respond to the different issues or if

clarifications are needed from the customer, additional documentation or the signature of a declaration by

the customer may be sought, bearing in mind materiality and proportionality criteria.

Consequences of evaluating ESG risks



As a result of the assessment of ESG risks, CaixaBank may approve a determining sanction for the

customer's onboarding (ESG onboarding) and to grant financing transactions to customers or project

financing (Environmental Risk Report).



6.2.2. Proprietary investment in fixed or variable-yield equities



Generally speaking, the approval of this Policy does not entail any changes to the processes in place for

deciding on a new asset. Therefore, any investment proposals for a new asset shall be subject to existing

policies, as well as to their implementing standards, criteria and procedures but with a new element,

namely, the addition of ESG criteria.



3 For example, controversies related to nature (biodiversity, land use, etc.), energy and climate change, water stress, pollution and waste, impact on local communities,

human rights, civil liberties, child labour, discrimination, freedom of association, occupational health and safety , the quality of products and services, relations with

consumers, supply chain management, anti-trust practices, privacy and data security, fraud and bribery, controversial investments, governance structures and others

related to environmental, social or governance controversies

© CaixaBank, S.A. 2024\. Regulatory compliance 13



The management model for this activity, adapted to specifics of the investment activityin question, is based

primarily on the compliance verification using the information provided by vendors that specialise in ESG

matters, on the most relevant question in this Policy, and on restrictions on investing in companies that are

directly or indirectly involved in controversial activities.



6.2.3. Managing the stock portfolio



The methodology explained above shall likewise apply to this activity, albeit with adaptations to the nature

of the internal management process and the materiality of the stocks, based on the activity and the main

country of the issuer, and using similar criteria to those written for the onboarding of corporate customers.

If the determination is made that the level of compliance with this Policy has to be evaluated in detail for

an investee by using a customised questionnaire or report, it will be the department handling the

investment that will provide the public information available.



6.2.4. Engagement



As part of its compliance with this Policy, CaixaBank maintains a regular dialogue with the companies it

finances and in which it invests, based on their relevance or influence. CaixaBank considers that this is the

best way of achieving a positive impact.

The activities that feature as exclusions under this Policy are not subject to engageme nt, as they are

incompatible with the bank ́s mission and principles. Nonetheless, for certain transactions or clients in

relation to which the ESG risk assessment process is carried out (see section 6.2.1), this evaluation may

determine that the customer does not fully comply with all the expectations established in the applicable

policies. In these cases, customers may be asked to work towards compliance with our evaluation criteria.

When breaches of this Policy by existing customers are detected,or the customer demonstrates insufficient

progress with the integration of measures in its daily operations, CaixaBank may engage with them on an

ad-hoc basis to encourage the customer to comply with CaixaBank ́s expectations and measures to avoid

further breaches in the future; or for the customer to submita plan that sets out how it intendson improving

its practices, including specific objectives and credible deadlines.



6.2.5. Discretionary portfolio management, investment advice and

asset management



CaixaBank offers discretionary portfolio management services and investment advice to its customers. The

former is offered by CaixaBank Asset Management in line with the delegation from management.

Furthermore, a number of Group companies, such as CaixaBank Asset Management and VidaCaixa,

manage assets on the customer ́s behalf, in this case, in the form of mutual funds, SICAVs and pension

funds. All of these are investment activities.

© CaixaBank, S.A. 2024\. Regulatory compliance 14



CaixaBank ́s policy sets out the general principles for all the Group ́s activities, focussing on financing

activity. In relation to investment activities, asset management, portfolio management and advice, the

principles established in the policies are adhered to, adapting them to the nature of the business in

question. With this in mind, an in-house ESG Risks policy is in place which is inspired by and which follows

the principles of the corporate policy for the management of sustainability/ESG risks at the group, adapted

to investmentactivities. In relation to the investment advice service, CaixaBankassesses the risk of including

ESG factors with the help of different suppliers when it comes to calculating these risks and the application

of the advisable investment universe.



6.2.6. Principal Adverse Impacts on sustainability factors



The social and environmental impacts of the activities performed by investees are monitored periodically,

subject to the availability of information. These detrimental impacts in relation to sustainability issues are

known as "principal adverse impacts" and are materialised, for example, in carbon emissions, exposure to

fossil fuels, waste levels, gender diversity, human rights violations and corruption, bribery and other

practices harmful to society and the environment. The Company prioritises the management of these

impacts in line with this Policy and other policies, strategies and commitments related to sustainability.



6.3 General criteria



Below, general criteria are provided in relation to core ESG issues (human rights, climate change and

nature), which are applicable to CaixaBank's customers in all sectors to which this Policy applies.



6.3.1. Human rights



Context and objectives



For the Group, a respect for human rights is an essential part of its values and provides a minimum

framework for the legitimate conduct of the Bank's activity. Similarly, it believes that the protection of

human rights depends primarily on governments, and that companies have the duty to promote and abide

by them over the course of their activities.

Given this premise, and in keeping with its policies and responsible stances on ethics and human rights,

CaixaBank operates under a culture of respect for human rights and expects its employees, collaborators,

partners and other parties directly involved in its operations, products and services to do so as well.

In order to mitigate the risk of being a participant in any violations, in addition to abiding by a series of

industry standards, CaixaBank also has a series of general exclusion criteria.

© CaixaBank, S.A. 2024\. Regulatory compliance 15



Applicable standards



When preparing the Policy to which these Principles refer, internationally recognised standards and

initiatives were taken into consideration, including:

• Universal Declaration of Human Rights

• The conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO)

• Equator Principles

• United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights

• National Action Plan of Business and Human Rights

• OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises

• The International Bill of Human Rights of the United Nations

• The UN Global Compact initiative

• International Finance Corporation (IFC) performance standards

• United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples

• Convention on the Rights of the Child

• Declaration on Human Rights Defenders



Aspects considered in the customer evaluation in relation to Human Rights:



The general ESG risk assessment process is set out in section 6.2.1 of this Policy. Furthermore, CaixaBank

takes the real and potential risks and impacts of its customers and operations on human rights.



As part of this due diligence process, CaixaBank assesses the performance of companies considering

aspects including but not limited to the following:

• Having a Human Rights, Sustainability, Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, Code of Ethics or Code

of Conduct.

© CaixaBank, S.A. 2024\. Regulatory compliance 16



• Being transparent when it comes to its performance and environmental, social and governance

approach, following the applicable some standards of brings in internationally recognised

sustainability.

• Having an Occupational Health and Safety Policy based on international standards (for example, ISO

45001 certification) and/or strong history as regards Health and Safety. In case of any controversy in

this matter, the mitigating measures taken will be explored.



The aspects mentioned above serve as guidelines for the customer evaluation in this matter, which shall

be considered whenever applicable based on their materiality and proportionality, with a view to

determining whether they satisfy the provisions of this Policy.



Exclusions



In terms of human rights, the Group establishes a series of general exclusions applicable to all

customersand transactions under the scope of this Policy (in any sector):

• Not provide financial services or invest in companies and their Groups for which there is solid evidence

that they rely on child or forced labour or that have taken part in human rights violations or abuses.

In the case of project financing, this exclusion also applies to the third parties involved when their

participation is significant.

• Do not provide financial services to or invest in companies and their economic groups that do not

have health and safety policies to protect their workers or that cannot provide adequate health and

safety records for their employees for the past five years.

• Not finance transactions or projects that violate the rights of indigenous or vulnerable groups, or

require their resettlement, without their free, prior and informed consent.



6.3.2. Climate change



Context and objectives



Climate change is one of the biggest challenges that the planet faces, with ramifications for the

environment, society and the economy.

The scientific community and organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

have concluded that only significant and persistentreductions in greenhouse gas emissions can limit global

warming and reduce the risks and impact of climate change.

In 2015, the Paris Accord laid out a worldwide action plan whose long-term goal is to limit the increase in

average global temperatures to well below 2º C based on pre-industrial levels, and limit the increase to

1.5º C.

It is CaixaBank's desire to help transition to a carbon-neutral economy, as reflected in the environmental

6.4 Sector criteria



6.4.1. Energy



Context and objectives



The energy sector is of major significance in the development of the global economy and access to secure

and affordable energy is a fundamental basic service for global well-being. However, CaixaBank is aware

that the energy sector can have a potentially negative impact both on society and the environment. To this

end, the transition process in the value chain based on reducing the use of fossil fuels and energy

generation based on low GHG emission energy production systems contributes substantially to reducing

these emissions into the atmosphere and, therefore, the fight against climate change. In addition,

consideration mustbe givento the adverse impact of the energysector on the environment and on society,

such as the impact on ecosystems, the generation of impacts on biodiversity caused by the construction

of energy infrastructure in sensitive areas, the generation of hazardous waste, occupational health and

safety and the impact on local communities. These risks must be handled appropriately to minimise the

impact on the environment and local communities.These impacts must be reconciled with increasing levels

of demand for cheaper, safer, cleaner and more efficient sources of energy.

Oil and gas



Oil and gas make up a large part of the global energy sector. Nonetheless, oil and gas exploration and

production can have negative impacts on the environment and on local communities, in particular in

relation to the extraction of unconventional oil and gas such as tar sands, shale or by means of fracking;

or when performed in complex areas such as ultra deepwater areas, the Arctic region or conflict zones.

Coal



Both the processing and combustion of coal generate significant environmental impacts, in particular as

regards the GHG emissions, which contribute significantly to climate change. Other adverse impacts of

this activity include gas emissions including sulphur and nitrogen oxides, leaks associated with carbon

capture and the use of high volumes of water.

Nuclear power



The improper use of nuclear power can lead to safety, health or environmental problems, such as

radioactive contamination, which can impact biodiversity and communities.

Renewable energy



In a context of fighting against climate change and transitioning towards a low -carbon economy, the

renewable energies sector (wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, biomass and others) is gaining strength

in the energy industry. It is the cleanest way to generate power, although its development and production

can have negative impacts on the environment and society if said impacts are not properly managed (for

example: water use or impact on biodiversity).

© CaixaBank, S.A. 2024\. Regulatory compliance 21



Sector scope



The energy sector covered by this policy includes customers dedicated to the following activities:

• Companies involved in the oil and gas industry, including the entire value chain;

• Processing and production: refining, including the petrochemical industry, refineries, gasification, etc.

• Electric power generation using fossil fuels; and using renewable energy sources;

• Heat generation using renewable energy sources and waste;

• Production of bioenergy used as an alternative to solid fuels.

• Commercial activities and services and logistics designed specifically or used for the energy sector,

including trade, which includes traders, maritime transport, oil pipelines, storage facilities, ships, floating

storage production and offloading, the mix and transmission, distribution and supply of heat and

electricity.

• Nuclear power generation.

Aspects considered in the customer evaluation in relation to the energy sector



CaixaBank expects its customers in the energy sector to follow and develop best industry practices in

relation to mitigating climate change, protecting biodiversity, occupational health and safety, protecting

the rights of local communities and safety at its facilities. The general assessment of ESG risks is explained

in section 6.2.1 of this Policy. As part of this due diligence process, as part of the assessment, consideration

is given to the following:

• Having a supply chain management system that takes into account environmental aspects, human

rights, or the health and safety of their vendors and subcontractors.

• In projects, having systems and procedures for cleaning spills as part of operations, control of the

pollutant gas emissions, the release and burning of gases and effluent spills.

As part of the evaluation of customers and transactions related to the energy sector, CaixaBank has

assumed its own decarbonisation commitments. In the energy sector, CaixaBank has established

decarbonisation objectives in relation to the electricity and oil and gas sectors. In addition, CaixaBank has

published its commitment of stopping financing for companies whose activities involve the use of thermal

coal, reducing the exposure to zero by 2030 (“phase out”).

The aspects mentioned above serve as guidelines for the customer evaluation in this matter, which shall

be considered whenever applicable based on their materiality and proportionality, with a view to

determining whether they satisfy the provisions of this Policy.

these customers in order to better engage with them, in line with the provisions of section 6.2.4 of this

Policy.



6.4.2. Mining



Context and objectives



The mining industry plays an essential role within the wider economy. It is a source of significant income

and wealth in numerous territories, providing decent jobs, corporate growth and tax revenue. Similarly,

some minerals are essential for other industries. Minerals such as phosphates and potassium are used in

the agricultural and chemical industries; metals are needed to produce consumer and capital goods, and

so forth. Recycling and other actions associated with the circular economy can certainly reduce the need

for raw materials, but are unlikely to eliminate this need altogether.

Yet at the same time, thisindustry can generate negative environmental and social impacts. For this reason,

CaixaBank believes it is essential to assess and manage the environmental, social and governance concerns

related to its business activities. It therefore expects its customers and the mining companies included in

its portfolios to comply rigorously with all applicable law and internationally recognised standards of

responsible business.

Sector scope



These criteria apply to companies involved in the mining industry, including the exploration, planning and

development, operation, closing and decommissioning of mines and the processing of the minerals

extracted (excluding oil and gas, the criteria for which are provided in the section on energy). As concerns

the processing of metals and minerals – including the refinement, casting and subsequent transformation

of metals and minerals extracted via mining activities.

As concerns the mining of uranium and other radioactive materials, as an exception, only those projects

or companies involved in the extraction of said materials for civilian purposes may be financed in those

cases in which the strictest international standards on health, safety and the environment are observed.



6.4.3. Transport and infrastructure



Context and objectives



The infrastructure sector is a major contributor to global economic growth by providing transportationand

telecommunications networks. In an increasingly globalised world with a growing population, the

importance of infrastructure cannot be understated. However, this sector faces potential environmental

and social challenges, such as degraded biodiversity, access to resources, waste generation, pollution,

impacts on local communities and more.

This sector includes companies whose activities related to the construction, operation and

decommissioning of transport, water management, waste management and telecommunications facilities

account for a significant portion of their activity.

Sector scope



Transport



The transportation industry is essential for global economic growth. The transportation of raw materials,

end products and people can generate significant environmental impacts. The sector needs to become

more energy efficient so as to ensure the sustainability of the transportation system.

Similarly, the construction and operation of transport facilities, such as ports, terminals, airports, railways

and motorways could have environmental and social impacts, depending on the areas where the activity

takes place.

Water management



Fresh water is in short supply, with rising levels of demand from the industrial and agricultural sectors and

households. A steady supply of water and the proper management of that water are required to support

life, develop the planet and protect the environment, and thus avoid negative impacts such as

desertification, aquifer depletion and droughts.

For instance, dams can play a huge role in the development of many countries by providing a reliable

supply of water to the public, yet they can also take their toll on the environment and local communities,

especially large dams, which often change the flow of rivers and impact flora and fauna and other natural

resources in the process.

Waste management



Good waste management is key to sustainable development. In particular, this can be achieved by

minimising our consumption of raw materials via reuse, recycling and other practices linked to the circular

economy, thus ensuring a more efficient use of natural resources.

© CaixaBank, S.A. 2024\. Regulatory compliance 29



Waste management involves collection, transportation and treatment. These activities, if not managed

properly, can generate significant environmental and social risks (to health), depending on the type of

waste to be treated.

Telecommunications and energy infrastructure:



The construction of telecommunications facilities, such as fibre optic cabling, or of energy infrastructures,

such as electric grids, oil or gas pipelines, is essential for economic and social development. However,these

infrastructures can generate significant environmental and social impacts depending on where they are

built.

All these detrimental environmental and social impacts can be avoided or minimised if companies properly

apply general international standards, or standards that are specific to their industry.

Applicable standards



When preparing the Policy to which these Principles refer, CaixaBank took into consideration the leading

internationally recognised standards and initiatives, including:

• OECD Framework for the Governance of Infrastructure

• World Commission on Dams (WCD)

• Dams and development project of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)

• Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM, READ)

• Convention on the safety and processing of spent fuel and on the safe management of radioactive

waste (Vienna, 1997)

• Requirements of the International Maritime Organization

• Industry-specific reference guidelines of the International Finance Corporation (IFC)

• The Poseidon Principles

• Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme (CORSIA)



 Climate-Aligned Finance Standard for the Aviation Sector (CAF)

Aspects considered in the customer evaluation in relation to the infrastructure and

transport sector



CaixaBank expects its customers in the infrastructure and transport sector to follow and develop best

industry practices in relation to protecting biodiversity, occupational health and safety,protecting the rights

of local communities and safety at its facilities.

The general ESG risk assessment process is set out in section 6.2.1 of this Policy. As part of this due diligence

process, CaixaBank assesses the performance of companies considering the following aspects:

• For air operators, whether they report the carbon footprint of their activity.

© CaixaBank, S.A. 2024\. Regulatory compliance 30



• In relation to the air transport sector, if they support the neutral growth in emissions for international

aviation under “CORSIA”.

• In particular for the maritime transport sector, a good practice to be taken into consideration is having

a Policy or proper in place for the recycling of ships.

• For companies in the maritime transport sector, and when applicable, an analysis is performed as to

whether they comply with the “IMO GHG Strategy”.

• Having a supply chain management system that takes into account environmental aspects, human

rights, or the health and safety of their vendors and subcontractors.

The aspects mentioned above serve as guidelines for the customer evaluation in this matter, which shall

be considered whenever applicable based on their materiality and proportionality, with a view to

determining whether they satisfy the provisions of this Policy.

Exclusions



The Group will not assume any credit risk in new projects involving:

• dams that violate the Framework of the World Commission on Dams.

• new desalination plants that do not consider measures to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from

the disposal of brine or the use of seawater10.



6.4.4. Agriculture, fishing, livestock and forestry



Context and objectives



Agriculture, fishing and ranching, in addition to providing food, are valuable sources of wealth that help to

create jobs, fight poverty and improve the food chain. Similarly, forestry and, in general, industrial forestry,

supply important resources to communities (foodstuffs, medicine, wood, water and air quality, spiritual and

aesthetic values), and forests and other natural spaces also harbour significant species diversity.

At the same time, the increased demand for foodstuffs, fibres and biofuels is putting pressure on

production that relies on existing resources, forcing it to expand to previously virgin areas. This can lead to

a loss of biodiversity and protected species; soil erosion and land degradation; emissions generated from

flare burning at plants and the use of fertilisers; contaminate sources of water; introduce invasive species

and lead to land disputes and human rights abuses (including child labour and forced relocation).

For this reason, CaixaBank insists that its corporate customers in these sectors assess and properly manage

the environmental and social impacts related to their activities.

6.4.5. Defence and security



Context and objectives



This policy defines the applicable procedures and standards through which CaixaBank addresses the ESG

risks related to the defence and security sector to perform its activities related to this sector in a responsible

manner. CaixaBank expects defence and security companies to comply with the applicable regulations and

international conventions ratified by the countries in which they are based.

CaixaBank and its subsidiaries will not intervene in the defence sector when there may be a clear risk of

defence material being used for repression or other serious breaches of international humanitarian law,

weapons conventions and Non-Proliferation Treaties and other related standards and guidelines. In this

connection, CaixaBank and its subsidiaries recognise the right of countries to defend and protect their

citizens and, as a result, may maintain business relations with companies related to the defence sector

whose activities are considered consistent with legitimate national security and defence strategies.

Furthermore, there has been an increase in use of services provided by private securities as part of the

activities of governments and companies worldwide. This industry is sensitive to human rights violations,

which is why customers in this sector require special attention.

Sector scope



CaixaBank, in line with standards applicable to this sector, considers the following definition of defence and

security as part of this Policy:

• Defence and security business: any company, group, institution, government agency or organisation

involved in the production, sales/supply, testing, research and development, integration in systems,

maintenance and services, including private security services.

Applicable standards



For the definition of controversial arms, CaixaBankuses the criteria included in the international agreements

on the matter. The different defence activities and/or material are classified into the following categories:



Conventional arms:

• Weapons (such as guns or other small arms, bombs, missiles or rockets), with the exception of arms

that fire blanks, are for sports use, replicas or collectors' items.

• Ammunitions and explosives when put to military use (including bullets, rockets, torpedoes, grenades,

mines, depth charges, etc.), provided that the target is not civilian.

• Especially designed components and essential equipment for the production, maintenance and use of

conventional weapons and ammunition; as well as software or hardware related to defence activities,

unless they are intended to provide for civil protection and safety.

• Dual-use items: any items that may be used for either civil or military purposes, when their destination

is military use. The CaixaBank Group uses the definition of dual-use items provided in EU regulation

428/2009 of the Council of 5 May 2009 on the control of exports and dual-use items, amended by

Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1969 of the Commission of 12 September 2016, and Regulation (EU)

2021/821 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2021 (repealing Regulation (EU)

428/2009, except for authorisation requests made before 9 September 2021).



Controversial arms:

Although there is no universally accepted definition of controversial arms, at the date of publication,

CaixaBank considers the following as a controversial arm, using the criteria established in international

agreements:

© CaixaBank, S.A. 2024\. Regulatory compliance 36



• Anti-personnel mines: Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer

of Anti-Personnel Mines (1997).

• Biological weapons: Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of

Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (1972).

• Chemical weapons: Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and

Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (1993). In addition, and although it is not included

in this agreement, CaixaBank considers the use of white phosphorus as a controversial arm.

• Cluster bombs: Convention on Cluster Munitions (2008).

• Ammunition that contains depleted uranium: although there is no international agreement in force,

CaixaBank recognises the concerns of some stakeholders in relation to depleted uranium ammunition.

• Nuclear weapons: Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968)

Aspects considered in the assessment of customers in the defence and security

sector:



To ensure the correct management of the Group ́s customers and transactions affected by ESG risks in

relation to the defence sector, periodic evaluation processes have bee n adapted and implemented. To

onboard a company related to the defence and security sector as a customer or to finance a transaction,

CaixaBank performs enhanced due diligence, analysing ESG risks to ensure that the customer or transaction

adheres to the ESG Risks Policy. This procedure applies to both new and existing customers and is

periodically updated for customers in this sector.
