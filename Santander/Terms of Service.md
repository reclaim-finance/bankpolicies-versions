1 INTRODUCTION



Purpose and context



Banco Santander, S.A. and its Group (“Santander” or “Santander Group”) recognises that

Environmental and Social (E\&S) issues pose significant challenges to the long-term prosperity of the

global economy, people and communities, and the natural environmental.

Santander is committed to supporting clients and economies in their transition to a low carbon

economy, providing financial products and/or services to business activities that are environmentally

and socially responsible in line with its sustainability commitments1. This is a continuous endeavour, at

different speeds for different countries, and with multiple external dependencies across public policy,

technological developments and consumer needs amongst other factors, requiring ongoing

engagement with clients in their transition to a low carbon economy. Attention must also be paid to

the social problems that may arise such as the involuntary displacement of the local and/or indigenous

population, the health, safety and human rights of the workers who carry out the business activities,

and the impacts on local communities and other stakeholders affected by these activities.

To support our fight against climate change, the Group will promote supporting customers navigate

the transition to a low carbon economy.

Santander Group has committed to:

- By 2030, stop investing in, and/or providing financial services to clients for whom coal fired

generation represents directly more than 10% of revenues on a consolidated basis.

- No exposure to thermal coal mining worldwide by 2030.

- Support international standards and treaties2.

This policy sets out certain activities that are prohibited and those that require special attention from

an environmental, social and climate change perspective in the Oil \& Gas, Power Generation and

transmission and Mining \& Metals sectors and those arising from businesses specifically engaged in

soft commodities.



Definition



This document sets out Santander Group’s criteria for (i) investing in entities, and/or (ii) providing

financial products and/or services to clients3 who develop the following activities:

• Oil \& gas: Exploration, extraction, production and treatment including refining, transportation,

storage and wholesale distribution4.



For the sake of clarity, any reference to a year will be considered as of 31 of December of that year.

1 Support the goals of the Paris Accord

2 See annex with non-exhaustive list of external references, regulations, standards and best practices

3 Defining clients as corporate entities (last parent company) hence not including funds. In the case of multi-industry

conglomerates with independent business entities across different industries, the Policy will apply at subsidiary level. Should

a subsidiary be prohibited, Santander might still provide products and services to the parent company (if they are unrelated

to the prohibited entity) and/or to other subsidiaries within the conglomerate.

4 Excluding distribution to the final consumer

• Power generation and transmission: All power plants regardless of energy source and the

construction and maintenance of electricity transmission lines5.

• Mining: prospecting and mining research, mining development and exploitation, restoration

and recovery of the exploited natural space.

• Metals: processing of ores to extract the metal they contain, production of alloys from ingots,

processing of by-products: scree, gangue, slag and sand.

• Soft Commodities: production and wholesale distribution of: timber products for processing

into lumber, wood-based cellulose, paper and textiles; soy; palm oil; rubber; cocoa; coffee;

cotton; sugarcane; biomass6 or biofuels, as well as beef production in High-Risk Geographies7.

Including those Santander Corporate and Investment Banking clients who acquire these

commodities directly from plantations or ranches, and they represent over 10% of their total

purchases.



For the purpose of this policy, financial products and/or services are defined as: transactions giving rise

to credit risk, insurance, asset management8, equity and advisory services.

Assessments of the relevant environmental social and climate change risk impacts will be required for

Santander Corporate and Investment Banking clients whose business activities relate to this policy.

This assessment of impacts should also be conducted in investment decisions for asset management

and insurance products.



Scope



This policy is prepared by Banco Santander, S.A., as parent company of Santander Group, establishing

the rules to be applied to the entire Group.

Group entities are responsible for their own internal regulations, and for developing and approving in

their respective governing bodies their own internal regulation that allows the application within its

scope of the provisions contained in the Group regulation, with the absolutely essential adjustments,

if any, to make them compatible and meet regulatory and management requirements or the

expectations of their supervisors.

Such approval must contain the validation of the Corporation.



5 Excluding distribution to the final consumer

6 Biomass is defined as “the biodegradable fraction of biological products, residues and waste from agriculture (including

vegetable and animal substances), forestry and similar industries (including fisheries and aquaculture)”.

7 High Risk Geographies are defined as: Any country in Africa, Argentina (only the Provinces of: Chaco, Formosa, Santiago del

Estero, Salta and Tucumán) Bolivia; Brazil (only the Legal Amazon and Northeast regions); Cambodia; China; Colombia;

Ecuador; Estonia; Guatemala; Guyana; Honduras; India; Indonesia; Laos; Latvia; Lithuania; Madagascar; Malaysia; Mexico;

2 PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES9



Santander Group will not directly invest in and/or provide financial products and/or services to the

following activities in any client segment:

• Any projects or activities for oil \& gas extraction, power generation or transmission, mining,

manufacturing, plantations or other major infrastructure projects which put areas classified as

Ramsar Sites10, World Heritage Sites11 or by the International Union for Conservation of

Nature12 (IUCN) as categories I, II, III or IV at risk.

• Projects that, in accordance with IFC Performance Standard 7 - Indigenous Peoples13, require

Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) and do not meet IFC Performance Standard 7 and there

is not a credible action plan to achieve compliance.

• Client activities, business relationships or facilitation of transactions that are or can be proven

to be linked to the commission of serious or gross violations of human rights14 or international

human rights law.

Oil \& Gas:

Clients:

• New oil upstream clients, except for transactions for the specific financing for new renewable

energy facilities.

• Clients involved in exploration and production for whom the activities derived from the

combination of fracking15, tar sands, coalbed methane and Arctic oil \& gas represent a

significant part of their reserves, or account for more than 30% of their activity.

Projects:

• Project-related financing to Oil upstream greenfield projects16.

• Any projects, or expansion of existing facilities, north of the Arctic Circle.

• Projects involved in the exploration, development, construction or expansion of oil \& gas

extraction from tar sands, fracking15 or coal bed methane.



9 To the extent required by applicable law, customers and transactions involving activities enumerated in this section will be

subject to an enhanced due diligence process to determine the unique risks presented prior to decisioning.

10 The Convention on Wetlands, called the Ramsar Convention, is the intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework

for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. (https://www.ramsar.org/)

11 World Heritage Sites: http://whc.unesco.org/en/list

12 The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (https://www.iucn.org) classifies protected areas according to

their environmental management objectives: Category I: Nature Reserve and Wilderness Areas, Category II: National Park,

Category III: Natural Monument or Feature, Category IV: Habitat/Species Management Area

13 https://www.ifc.org/en/insights-reports/2012/ifc-performance-standard-7

14 Considering child labour, forced labour, discrimination at work, freedom of association, working conditions, grievance

mechanisms for workers, occupational health and safety issues, impacts on communities and land grabbing.

15 Due to the necessity to support the energy transition, energy security and affordability, and in situations where there can

be exceptional social and economic implications, that could ultimately enable the transition and may play a crucial role in

the economic and social local development (developing countries/emerging economies), exceptions in relation to fracking

may be considered in jurisdictions where these activities are permissible under local regulation, subject to enhanced due

diligence and appropriate approval.

16 Defining Greenfield as those fields whose approval for development is after May 2021.
