KBC GROUP ENERGY CREDIT, INSURANCE ANDADVISORY SERVICES POLICY



KBC Group’s support for the Paris COP21 Agreement and the 2 ° C scenario, striving for 1.5°C,is a general reflection of its broader ambition – translated in the KBC Sustainability Strategy –of contributing towards a low-carbon society. In September 2019, KBC strengthened itsclimate commitment by signing the Collective Commitment to Climate Action (CCCA), aninitiative of the UN Environmental Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). The energy sector iscrucial to the transition towards a low-carbon economy, but it will face substantial challengesin this regard, such as securing the energy supply as demand grows and further increasing theshare of renewable energy.



Commitment



KBC’s ambition is to gradually increase the share of renewables in the KBC Energy CreditPortfolio to at least 75% by 2030 at the latest. To help achieve this:



• KBC supports renewable energy, such as hydro, solar and wind;

• KBC will only consider financing biomass and biofuel activities subject to stringentconditions, including careful consideration of environmental impacts.

KBC takes a clear and concrete stance on:



• activities in the energy sector that KBC no longer wishes to support through lending,providing insurance or providing advisory services 1 (see below for exclusions);

• the conditions to be met by each counterparty in non-excluded areas to be/remaineligible for loans, insurance or advisory services.

KBC also takes into account the characteristics of the available energy sources (in particulartheir environmental acceptability), technological possibilities and limitations, anticipatedmarket trends, local specificities as well as local and European regulation.

1 Within the scope of this policy, “advisory services” should be understood as the advisory services provided byKBC Securities and KBC entities providing similar services in Central Europe. This includes e.g. advice on debt andequity capital market transactions and on M\&A transactions.

Implementation



Coal-fired energy generation, including coal mining



In general, KBC does not want to be involved in the financing, insuring or providing advisoryservices with regard to thermal coal (electricity generation, district heating and mining).Thermal coal is any type of coal (hard, bituminous, sub-bituminous, brown coal or lignite, peat,and also including coal-to-gas and coal-to liquids) used to produce electricity or heat.

KBC will not only abstain from any direct financing or insurance of coal related projects (bothenergy production and mining), but also from general corporate and any other financing andinsurance of energy companies, when such companies:



• new customers: have any portion of their energy production capacity which is coal-fired;

• existing customers: have more than 25% of their energy production capacity which iscoal-fired.

Moreover, KBC will from now on request that all existing customers, regardless of the fact thatthey are energy companies or not, with any coal-fired energy production capacity:



• submit a realistic and detailed plan, explaining how coal is to be entirely phased out by2030;

• commit not to engage into any new coal project (both energy production and mining),either by increasing existing capacity or by acquiring new capacity.

From 2030 on, KBC will abstain from all financing or insurance of and advisory services toenergy companies which have any coal-fired energy production capacity or are involved inmining.In order however to ensure the financing of the necessary energy transition, both for existingand new customers, KBC remains prepared to finance renewable energy projects, even whena company still has coal-fired energy production and did not submit a coal phase out plan nordid commit not to engage into new coal projects, providing that the renewable energy projectshave a demonstrable and significant utility regarding the energy transition and that sufficientmeasures are in place in order to guarantee that the projects are entirely ring-fenced from thecompany’s other activities. Similarly, KBC remains prepared to finance gas-fired plantsprojects replacing coal based production capacity (“gas-as-a-transition”) and nuclear powerplant projects, even when a company still has coal-fired energy production, providing that itsubmitted a coal phase out plan, that it committed not to engage into new coal projects andthat sufficient measures are in place in order to guarantee that the projects are entirely ring-fenced from the company’s other activities.

Also, given the current local energy mix, local government policies and KBC’s responsibilitytowards the local economies and societies in which it operates, some exceptions remain withregard to financing by CSOB in the Czech Republic. More specifically, the financing by CSOB inthe Czech Republic of non-coal related projects remains possible for existing customers, evenwhen a company’s coal-fired energy production capacity exceeds 25%, providing that theseprojects are linked to:



• environmental improvements not related to an active coal-fired plant or coal mine;

• social good causes.

The financing of projects such as coal mines, coal-fired electricity generation and districtheating projects is never allowed. All remaining such exposure at CSOB in the Czech Republichas been repaid as planned by the end of 2021.

KBC will furthermore abstain from the financing of transactions related to the supply ofcomponents which are deemed essential to coal-based electricity and heating plants and coalmines.

Finally, KBC will also abstain from trade finance transactions when thermal coal is theunderlying good of the transaction.



Renewables



KBC will support financing, insuring or providing advisory services with regard tocounterparties active in the hydro, solar and wind renewable segment. Special attention willbe given to the assessment of:



• policies and subsidies in the counterparty’s home country;

• the impact of a reduction in/termination of government support on the counterparty’srepayment capacity;

• the electricity system in the counterparty’s home country.



Biomass



Financing, insurance or advisory services regarding biomass/biofuels/bioliquids activities arepermitted, subject to a set of conditions to be respected in full:

1. GHG reductions must comply with current EU requirements;2. Sustainable inputs:

• Food: only acceptable where the food is not fit for human consumption;

• Inputs should comply with the European Commission’s non-bindingrecommendation on sustainability criteria for biomass;

• Input sourcing should be abundantly available;

• Sustainable transport: no excessive transport of input materials or by-products;

3. Financing of biomass/biofuels/bioliquids is to be limited to plants within the EU;4. Positive assessment of technology risk.



Oil and gas



KBC refrains from financing, insuring or providing advisory services with regard to:



• oil-fired power generation, both new and upgrades;

• exploration and development of unconventional oil and gas, both existing and new,including:

− Arctic and Antarctic on- and off-shore oil and gas;

− deep water drilling;

− tar sands;

− shale oil and gas;

− coalbed methane.

• “Arctic” is to be understood according to the definition of the Arctic Monitoring andAssessment Programme (AMAP).

• exploration of any other new oil or gas fields;

• specialised companies that are only active in the development and extraction of oiland gas fields.

As for vertically integrated oil and gas companies, all new financing shall mature in 2030 atthe latest, unless the company has publicly committed to no longer start operating new fields.Limited exceptions linked to the energy transition apply.

KBC will otherwise continue to finance, insure or provide advisory services linked to oil andgas-based activities, albeit subject to stringent conditions.



Nuclear



KBC will continue to finance, insure or provide advisory services regarding activities related tonuclear power generation under stringent conditions, including compliance with the IAEAAction Plan on Nuclear Safety and the EURATOM New Safety Directive. KBC is only preparedto participate in the financing or insurance of, or to provide advisory services to new nuclearpower plants if the project is part of an energy transition strategy and supported by the localgovernment.
