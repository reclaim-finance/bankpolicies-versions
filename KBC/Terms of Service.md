KBC GROUP ENERGY CREDIT, INSURANCE AND

ADVISORY SERVICES POLICY



KBC Group’s support for the Paris COP21 Agreement and the 2°C scenario, striving for 1.5°C,

is a general reflection of its broader ambition – translated in the KBC Sustainability Strategy –

of contributing towards a low-carbon society. In September 2019, KBC strengthened its

climate commitment by signing the Collective Commitment to Climate Action (CCCA), an

initiative of the UN Environmental Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). The energy sector is

crucial to the transition towards a low-carbon economy, but it will face substantial challenges

in this regard, such as securing the energy supply as demand grows and further increasing the

share of renewable energy.



Commitment



KBC’s ambition is to gradually increase the share of renewables in the total KBC Energy Credit

Portfolio to at least 75% by 2030 at the latest. To help achieve this:



• KBC supports renewable energy, such as hydro, solar and wind;

• KBC will only consider financing biomass and biofuel activities subject to stringent

conditions, including careful consideration of environmental impacts.



KBC takes a clear and concrete stance on:



• activities in the energy sector that KBC no longer wishes to support through lending,

providing insurance or providing advisory services1 (see below for exclusions);

• the conditions to be met by each counterparty in non-excluded areas to be/remain

eligible for loans, insurance or advisory services.



KBC also takes into account the characteristics of the available energy sources (in particular

their environmental acceptability), technological possibilities and limitations, anticipated

market trends, local specificities as well as local and European regulation.



1 Within the scope of this policy, “advisory services” should be understood as the advisory services provided by

KBC Securities and KBC entities providing similar services in Central Europe. This includes e.g. advice on debt and

equity capital market transactions and on M\&A transactions.

Implementation



Coal-fired energy generation, including coal mining



In general, KBC does not want to be involved in the financing, insuring or providing advisory

services with regard to thermal coal (electricity generation, district heating and mining).

Thermal coal is any type of coal (hard, bituminous, sub-bituminous, brown coal or lignite, peat,

and also including coal-to-gas and coal-to liquids) used to produce electricity or heat.



KBC will not only abstain from any direct financing or insurance of coal related projects (both

energy production and mining), but also from general corporate and any other financing and

insurance of energy companies, when such companies:



• new customers: have any portion of their energy production capacity which is coal-

fired;

• existing customers: have more than 25% of their energy production capacity which is

coal-fired.



Moreover, KBC will from now on request that all existing customers, regardless of the fact that

they are energy companies or not, with any coal-fired energy production capacity:



• submit a realistic and detailed plan, explaining how coal is to be entirely phased out by

2030; such a plan should be submitted by the end of 2022 for large companies and by

the end of 2023 for smaller companies;

• commit not to engage into any new coal project (both energy production and mining),

either by increasing existing capacity or by acquiring new capacity.



From 2030 on, KBC will abstain from all financing or insurance of and advisory services to

energy companies which have any coal-fired energy production capacity or are involved in

mining.



In order however to ensure the financing of the necessary energy transition, both for existing

and new customers, KBC remains prepared to finance renewable energy projects, even when

a company’s still has coal-fired energy production and did not submit a coal phase out plan

nor did commit not to engage into new coal projects, providing that the renewable energy

projects have a demonstrable and significant utility regarding the energy transition and that

sufficient measures are in place in order to guarantee that the projects are entirely ring-fenced

from the company’s other activities.



Also, given the current local energy mix, local government policies and KBC’s responsibility

towards the local economies and societies in which it operates, some exceptions remain with

regard to financing by CSOB in the Czech Republic. More specifically, the financing by CSOB in

the Czech Republic of non-coal related projects remains possible for existing customers, even

when a company’s coal-fired energy production capacity exceeds 25%, providing that these

projects are linked to:



• environmental improvements not related to an active coal-fired plant or coal mine;

• social good causes.



The financing of projects such as coal mines, coal-fired electricity generation and district

heating projects is never allowed. All remaining such exposure at CSOB in the Czech Republic

has been repaid as planned by the end of 2021.



KBC will furthermore abstain from the financing of transactions related to the supply of

components which are deemed essential to coal-based electricity and heating plants and coal

mines.



Finally, KBC will also abstain from trade finance transactions when thermal coal is the

underlying good of the transaction.



Renewables



KBC will support financing, insuring or providing advisory services with regard to

counterparties active in the hydro, solar and wind renewable segment. Special attention will

be given to the assessment of:



• policies and subsidies in the counterparty’s home country;

• the impact of a reduction in/termination of government support on the counterparty’s

repayment capacity;

• the electricity system in the counterparty’s home country.



Biomass



Financing, insurance or advisory services regarding biomass/biofuels/bioliquids activities are

permitted, subject to a set of conditions to be respected in full:



1. GHG reductions must comply with current EU requirements;

2. Sustainable inputs:

• Food: only acceptable where the food is not fit for human consumption;

• Inputs should comply with the European Commission’s non-binding

recommendation on sustainability criteria for biomass;

• Input sourcing should be abundantly available;

• Sustainable transport: no excessive transport of input materials or by-products;

3. Financing of biomass/biofuels/bioliquids is to be limited to plants within the EU;

4. Positive assessment of technology risk.

Oil and gas



KBC refrains from financing, insuring or providing advisory services with regard to:



• oil-fired power generation, both new and upgrades;

• exploration and development of unconventional oil and gas, both existing and new,

including:

− Arctic and Antarctic on- and off-shore oil and gas;

− deep water drilling;

− tar sands;

− shale oil and gas;

− coalbed methane.

• “Arctic” is to be understood according to the definition of the Arctic Monitoring and

Assessment Programme (AMAP).

• exploration of any other new oil or gas fields;

• specialised companies that are only active in the development and extraction of oil

and gas fields.



As for vertically integrated oil and gas companies, all new financing shall mature in 2030 at

the latest, unless the company has publicly committed to no longer start operating new fields.

Limited exceptions linked to the energy transition apply.



KBC will otherwise continue to finance, insure or provide advisory services linked to oil and

gas-based activities, albeit subject to stringent conditions.



Nuclear



KBC will continue to finance, insure or provide advisory services regarding activities related to

nuclear power generation under stringent conditions, including compliance with the IAEA

Action Plan on Nuclear Safety and the EURATOM New Safety Directive. KBC is only prepared

to participate in the financing or insurance of, or to provide advisory services to new nuclear

power plants if the project is part of an energy transition strategy and supported by the local

government.
