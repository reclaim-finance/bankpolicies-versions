Purpose and scope



Purpose



The Responsible Investment Policy (the “Policy”)

describes the framework governing the approach

of Nordea Asset Management (“NAM”) to

responsible investments. NAM has two ESG

focused committees with specific areas of

responsibility:



• The Responsible Investment Committee

(“RIC”) decides and monitors exclusions and

engagements at investment level



• The ESG Committee secures the governance

of our ESG related methods and principles.

An ESG Operational Forum facilitates discus-

sions and secures alignment and coordina-

tion on ESG matters across the NAM value

chain, ensuring that the relevant decisions

are brought to the ESG Committee for

approval. The ESG Committee is also respon-

sible for the content of and adherence to this

Policy



Both Committees include members from the

Senior Executive Management team and are

chaired by the head of NAM, who is also the CEO

of Nordea Asset Management Holding AB.



1) The concept of double materiality refers to, on the one hand,

those ESG/sustainability risks that are material to the financial

performance of an investee company or other entity, and, on



Nordea Asset Management’s mission is to create

returns with responsibility by



• being ESG-proactive

• delivering excess returns

• offering access to the right assets

• demonstrating operational excellence and

transparency

• maintaining industry-leading risk and

performance management



By ESG-proactive we mean



• integrating environmental, social and

governance factors into our investment

processes, taking into account both sides of

the “double materiality”1

• actively engaging with our investee

companies to ensure that they meet our

expectations of sound ESG performance and

compliance with international norms

• offering a wide range of ESG solutions across

all asset classes

• accepting the responsibility to act as an

industry leader within ESG/sustainability



the other, to the environmental and social impact of the

activities of the same company or entity. The two will typically

be closely linked, but should not be conflated.

Scope



NAM, or NAM Holding, which is the asset

management subsidiary of Nordea Bank Abp,

includes Nordea Investment Management AB

(“NIM”) and Nordea Investment Funds S.A.

(“NIFSA”). NIM is a Swedish investment firm

authorised to, inter alia, provide discretionary

portfolio management services, and NIFSA is a

management company authorised by the CSSF

(the Luxembourg FSA) to manage UCITS and

alternative investment funds. Nordea Funds Ltd

(“NF”), is a management company authorized by

the Finnish FSA.



This Policy applies to all our Nordea-branded

investment strategies, including all the active and

passive investment funds managed by NIFSA

and NF.



The Policy does not apply to selected

discretionary mandates where the client has

opted out of the Policy.



Due to the nature of certain investments, such as

derivatives and units in external funds, the Policy

may also not apply to a limited type of underlying

investment, whilst applying at the level of the

portfolio.



This Policy is reviewed and updated as required

and at least annually.

Advocacy and

memberships



NAM became a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investments (the

“PRI”) in 2007 and has offered strategies with sectoral screening since 1988.



In 2019, NAM publicly committed to aligning our

investment strategies with the objectives of the

Paris Agreement. This means that we have a

long-term strategic objective to reduce the

greenhouse gas emissions impact of our invest-

ments in line with the “well below 2°C” ambition,

increase our investments based on climate-

related opportunities and ensure that our invest-

ment portfolios are resilient to climate-related

risks. Since 2020, we are a founding member of

the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative.



Our Responsible Investment Policy aims to

encourage the companies we invest in to support

the United Nations Sustainable Development

Goals (“SDGs”) and comply with international

conventions and norms, including, but not limited

to:



• United Nations Global Compact

• OECD Principles of Corporate Governance

• OECD Guidelines for Multinational

Enterprises

• Universal Declaration of Human Rights

• UN Guiding Principles on Business and

• Human Rights

• Children’s Rights and Business Principles

• ILO conventions on labour standards

• Rio Declaration on Environment and

Development

• UN Convention on Corruption

• Convention on Cluster Munitions



We support standardised and integrated report-

ing, which incorporates material sustainability

information with financial information and pro-

vides consistent and comparable ESG data,

preferably using the SASB framework or similar.

We also support and promote the adoption of the

recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-

related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”).



In this context, we actively engage with various

standard-setters and stakeholders locally and in-

ternationally. We are active members of the PRI,

SASB, IIGCC, CDP, TPI, Finance for Biodiversity

Pledge and Investor Alliance for Human Rights.



Nordea Asset Management adheres to the

ESG4Real standard for a select number of funds

and complies with the certification criteria

through the integration of exclusion, norm-based

screening and active ownership into the invest-

ment process.

Our responsible

investment approach



We believe that it is our fiduciary duty to deliver returns with responsibility.



NAM ́s responsible investment framework builds

on the PRI. We strive to achieve ESG integration

spanning a range of products through five main

mechanisms:



• norm-based screening

• sustainability risk integration

• NAM-level PAI consideration

• NAM-level exclusion list

• active ownership and engagement



NAM has developed policies and procedures to

ensure that the companies we invest in meet our

expectations of ESG performance and that

ESG/sustainability risk is managed in our invest-

ment processes. This is supported by a robust

norm-based screening process and principal

adverse impact (“PAI”)2 analysis. In addition, we

consider and take a stance on an ongoing basis,

across our portfolios, on issues relating to climate

change, human rights, good governance and bio-

diversity/water. All of the above inform our active

ownership and engagement policy and our

exclusion list at the firm level – our “firm-level

overlay”.



For a substantial part of our assets under

management, we aim to achieve deeper ESG in-

tegration with hands on involvement of the

Responsible Investment team in our STARS strat-

egies and thematic strategies (including climate,

social empowerment and gender diversity portfo-

lios) and our internally developed ESG scoring of



2) Principal adverse impact on entity-level is reported annually

in accordance with the EU SFDR. Principal adverse impact

indicators, as defined by the EU SFDR, capture the

environmental and social or “outward” part of the “double



investee companies. Many individual products

also have sector-based or other exclusion criteria

beyond those implemented at the firm level.

Given the size of NAM’s investment universe

across its various investment boutiques and

strategies, we use a range of external providers

of ESG data as well as internal research and our

proprietary ESG scoring platform. These data

providers and other data sources are assessed on

an ongoing basis for data quality, coverage and

other attributes.



As for all ESG-oriented asset managers and asset

owners, the dilemma of choosing between en-

gagement and exclusion is central for NAM. The

argument for exclusion rests on the need to

clearly mark the limits of which corporate activity

and/or behaviours are deemed acceptable and

which are not. The argument for engagement, on

the other hand, recognises that the real-world

effect of exclusion can be negligible, at least in

the short term. Whenever one market participant

sells off a security, another, presumably with

lower standards of propriety, is buying it. Thus, it

can be argued that retaining a security, engaging

with the company and – where applicable –

voting at its AGMs, is more effective. Added com-

plexity is introduced by the likelihood that exclu-

sion by some investors may make a company

with substandard practices more open to the

engagement efforts of the remaining owners and

thus to improving its practices over a longer

timeframe.



materiality”, as opposed to sustainability risk, which captures

the financial materiality of ESG issues to the valuation of a

security.

3/



At NAM we believe that there are activities and

types of behaviour that cannot be reconciled with

our mission of delivering returns with responsibil-

ity. Companies exhibiting these on an ongoing

basis are excluded from our investment universe.

There is a large category of economic activities

which on the one hand may contribute positively

to one or more SDG, while potentially having a

negative impact on others. Activities and compa-

nies in this category are excluded from many

Nordea-branded investment strategies (see be-



low for NAM’s strategy-specific approaches and

our Paris-aligned Fossil Fuel Policy), while still

being investible for more traditional strategies.



Assuming that engagement is most effective

when it is supported by an implicit but clearly un-

derstood threat of ultimate exclusion, we believe

that this allows NAM to be more compelling in its

engagement, up to the point where the decision

is taken to exclude a company at the NAM firm-

level.

3.1 NAM-level overlay



NAM ́s responsible investment framework com-

prises the availability of ESG data to all portfolio

managers as well as a baseline integration of

ESG safeguards, such as norm-based screening,

PAI consideration and a common exclusion list,

governed by our Responsible Investment Com-

mittee and implemented across our Nordea-

branded investment strategies. In addition, all

NAM’s internal investment boutiques take into

account sustainability risk as part of their port-

folio management processes. The decisions taken

in the RIC ensure that our Nordea-branded in-

vestment strategies live up to NAM’s minimum

ESG requirements, independent of the individual

strategies’ specific ESG profiles.



3.1.1 Norm-based screening

Our Nordea-branded investment strategies are

subject to norm-based screening, which identifies

companies that are allegedly involved in

breaches of international law and norms on envi-

ronmental protection, human rights, labour

standards and anti-corruption. If a company is

identified in this screening process, an internal

assessment of the company and the incident is

initiated. The assessment is conducted by the

Responsible Investment team, which provides a

recommendation to the RIC, upon which the RIC

decides on actions to be taken. Typical actions in-

clude engagement, quarantine or exclusion. A

quarantine implies that the holdings of NAM

portfolios in the company concerned may not be

increased and a quarantine will in nearly all cases

be accompanied by direct engagement with the



company. The RIC may also conclude that the

issue raised does not merit immediate action,

either because it has already been resolved or it

is judged to be minor/immaterial.



3.1.2 NAM-level PAI consideration

The environmental and social impact of the activ-

ities of our investee companies is monitored on

an ongoing basis, subject to data availability,

using an internally-developed monitoring system.

Companies identified as outliers on entity level,

on one or more PAI indicators are analysed

further by the Responsible Investment team and

a recommendation for action is made to the RIC,

in a process similar to the one described above

for norm breaches. Additional PAI consideration

can take place at the individual investment

strategy level. Our disclosure statement on the

consideration of principal adverse impact at

entity-level can be found on our websites. The

principal adverse impact of our investments is

reported annually in this statement.



3.1.3 NAM-level exclusion list

Recognising that some types of economic activity

or corporate behaviour are not compatible with

our mission of returns with responsibility, NAM

maintains a firm-level exclusion list that is ap-

plied in accordance with the scope of this Policy.

Any addition to – or removal from – the list is de-

cided by the RIC.

9



3/



NAM excludes companies involved in serious

breaches of international norms where

engagement is deemed not to be possible or

effective, as discussed above. For example, we

ban investment in companies active in the

production of controversial weapons, including –

but not limited to – cluster munitions and anti-

personnel mines as well as nuclear weapons.

NAM excludes companies involved in production

or distribution of pornography and companies

involved in the production of tobacco with a 5%

revenue threshold. NAM also does not invest in

companies deriving more than 5% of their

revenues from thermal coal, and has additional

investment restrictions for power generation

companies without coal phase out plans, or with

coal power expansion activity. In addition, NAM

excludes companies involved in the production of

fossil fuels from oil sands (5% revenue threshold)

or through arctic drilling. A substantial and



growing part of our strategies is also subject to

our Paris-aligned Fossil Fuel Policy (“PAFF”),

which excludes companies involved in fossil fuel

production, distribution or services if they do not

have a recognised strategy to achieve an

emissions path that is consistent with the Paris

Agreement’s goal3.



For strategies where the PAFF is not

implemented as a hard exclusion criterion, the

PAFF acts as guidance for engagement. The

PAFF criteria also inform the prioritisation of our

top-down thematic engagements.



The NAM-level exclusion list can be found here4.



The NAM Paris-aligned Fossil Fuel Policy can be

found here.



3) This analysis builds on data from the Transition Pathway

Initiative (TPI), among other sources. Information on the TPI

can be found here.



4 Nordea Asset Management always takes the best interest of

the fund unit holders into consideration. To protect our fund

unit holders, this exclusion list may from time to time not

include all excluded issuers.

3.1.4 Active ownership and engagement

On behalf of our clients, we undertake a range of

engagement activities with investee companies

in order to encourage them to improve their

environmental, social and governance practices,

including promoting a long-term approach to

decision-making. Our active ownership tools



include voting, attending AGMs, standard setting,

engagement with companies, and filing

resolutions. Our engagement with investee

companies falls into three main categories, which

can overlap and be applied to a given company

simultaneously:



NAM engagement process

Engagements



- Proposed by

investment

11



3/



Thematic engagements may be undertaken ei-

ther by NAM alone or in collaboration with other

asset managers and asset owners. Collaborative

engagements can take place within the frame-

work of industry initiatives such as Climate Action

100+, SASB, PRI, CDP or the Investor Alliance for

Human Rights or through ad hoc initiatives. NAM

will in some cases initiate and lead such ad hoc

investor alliances. NAM’s thematic engagements

typically concern issues under one of the core ar-

eas of interest identified in NAM’s ESG approach:



• climate

• human rights

• good governance

• biodiversity/water



Investment-led engagements are initiated and

executed at the individual strategy and invest-

ment boutique level.



Norms engagements are triggered by allegation

of norm breaches, PAI red flags or other serious

negative news flows.



In tandem with our direct engagement with com-

panies, voting is undertaken at as many AGMs as

practically possible, prioritising votes related to

the four core areas listed above, while in general

insisting that companies 1) act in the long-term

interest of shareholders, 2) safeguard the rights

of all shareholders, 3) ensure an efficient and

independent board structure, 4) align incentive

structures for employees with the long-term

interest of shareholders, 5) disclose information

to the public in a timely, accurate and adequate

manner and 6) ensure high social, environmental

and ethical standards and accountability.



For more information, please refer to the NIM

Engagement Policy, the NIFSA Corporate

Governance Principles, and the NF Corporate

Governance Principles.



The quality of the engagement process is audited

by internal audit on a regular basis. NAM com-

plies with a number of national and supra-

national corporate governance codes.



Political engagement - we may participate in

activities that can be considered as political en-

gagement, such as providing feedback on regula-

tions and expressing support to policy makers

through public endorsement in investor state-

ments. We may also conduct policy engagement,

which are activities focused on public policy

dialogues with governments as well as public

authorities on specific ESG issues. These activities

align with our core values and our strategy to

deliver returns with responsibility.



These type of activities are subject to careful con-

sideration and diligence. We always assess the

appropriateness of an activity that could be con-

sidered as political, before we decide to enter

into it, and always assess the potential impact of

such activity. Our activities focus solely on ESG

issues, and do not intend to favour any specific

political party or ideology5. We believe that our

participation in political activities can contribute

to long-term value creation and have a positive

impact on society.



3.1.5 How we integrate ESG

NAM has implemented several initiatives to sup-

port ESG integration throughout the whole firm.

Our investment boutiques have access to NAM’s

proprietary ESG database and ESG analysis from

the Responsible Investment team, as well as ESG

data from external data providers. NAM’s Risk \&

Performance team has integrated information on

portfolio ESG/sustainability risks in their daily

report to the analysts and portfolio managers.



The Responsible Investment team conducts

workshops on ESG topics and provides

walkthroughs of developments, where different

use-case-scenarios of the data are presented.



5) Whilst we are registered as a lobbyist in the United States

as a prudent measure, we do not make political contributions

nor engage in activities which would require such registration.

12



3/



3.1.6 Escalation

Which tools are at our disposal?



Collaborative Engagement

We believe that joining forces with other

investors in engaging with companies is an

effective way to achieve successful engagement

outcomes. While we also engage individually, we

see collaborative engagements as an important

part of our Active Ownership work. Engaging in

this way allows us to share views with other

industry players, and to scale up the impact of

our engagements.



Stakeholder Engagement

Interacting or partnering with other stakeholders

such as trade or industry organizations, NGOs,

experts, standard setters and regulatory bodies

can be an efficient means of escalating an

engagement.



Media and Events

Using different media channels, organizing

webinars and conferences to further

engagements with companies or industries are

another method to escalate engagements and

raise awareness.



Public Statements

We may individually or jointly with other

investors or organizations issue public

statements to highlight our position on a key ESG

topic, our differing views or our expectations on

best practices and conduct.



Letters to CEO or Board of Directors

To make our voice heard at the highest levels in a

company and to underline our expectations on

key issues, we may send letters to either the CEO,

the Board Chair, Independent Directors, or to

individual members of the Board, such as those

chairing specific committees, either individually

or together with other investors. These letters

can be open or submitted in confidence.



Annual General Meetings

At AGMs, we can use our voting rights as well as

the overall meeting to influence the company,

escalate an engagement or lay out our support

for or opposition to specific issues and votable

items.



Proxy Voting: We aim to vote at all companies we

are invested in and in order to do so we attend

AGMs and use proxy voting. At the AGM we can

use our voting rights and power to support or

vote against directors, items and shareholder and

management proposals. We can thus use our

voting rights and power to influence companies

on certain matters and to support and escalate

our engagements.



AGM Communication: In addition to voting, we

can ask questions, express concerns or read out

statements (during the Q\&A or submitted

beforehand).



Pre-AGM Meetings: At pre-AGM meetings

initiated by us or the company, we can discuss

certain items on the ballot related to an

engagement and discuss our voting intention and

rationale with the company. These meetings

allow us to further highlight our position on key

issues and why we may be inclined to vote

against management items or for specific

shareholder resolutions.



(Co-)filing of Shareholder Resolutions: We may

file or co-file shareholder resolutions with other

investors to put an expected change of behavior

or disclosure up for vote at a company’s AGM.



To gather support for a shareholder proposal

which we have co-filed, we can initiate investor

campaigns and/or file exempt solicitations.



Pre-declaration of voting intentions: We can also

pre-declare our voting intentions, for example via

the PRI voting platform, our own homepage or

via other channels.

13



3/



Quarantine

We may quarantine a company, meaning

portfolio managers cannot increase their position,

for all NAM funds or for a subset (for example in

the STARS, Responsible and Thematic ranges)

should a controversy arise related to the

company.



The quarantine will be kept in place until we

have reasonable grounds that the company is

addressing or remediating the issue. Should this

not happen, we may ultimately exclude the

company.



Exclusion

In cases of serious breaches of international

norms on environmental protection, human

rights, labor standards, anti-corruption, or other

norms, we may initiate an internal assessment of

the company and the incident, with the ultimate

outcome potentially being exclusion across all

Nordea funds.



De facto exclusions may also be applied only for

specific types of funds, for example our STARS,

Responsible and Thematic ranges.

14



3/



Our Escalation Process – Norms Engagements

While all engagements may be escalated, we

follow a clear, time-bound and delineated pro-

cess for our ‘RIC Norms’ engagements. These en-

gagements take place with companies that are

alleged to be in breach of international norms or

conventions or those involved in significant ESG-

related incidents.



Using our data providers, we screen our

investment portfolio for companies which are

alleged to be in breach of international norms or

conventions. Should an allegation of a breach be

detected, our Responsible Investments team assesses

the case based on factors such as severity, magnitude

of impact, as well as the company’s degree of

involvement and culpability. This assessment is

presented to our Responsible Investments

Committee (RIC), which is chaired by Nordea

Asset Management’s CEO and convenes on a

quarterly basis.



Following the presentation of the case to RIC, the

committee may decide that a direct exclusion is

warranted or that the Responsible Investments

team should initiate an engagement related to

the breach to acquire further information and/or

a commitment to remediation. If the matter is

deemed by RIC to be inconsequential, the com-

mittee may also decide to take no further action.



If RIC decides that an engagement should be

initiated, we follow a clear process, with time-

bound milestones that must be met. Depending

on the severity of the case, the response or

responsiveness of the company, as well as

additional information we receive during the

engagement, we may decide to make use of the

additional escalation tools described in 3.16,

quarantine or exclude the company.



Following the decision to engage, we contact

the company highlighting the alleged breach,

and requesting a meeting with representatives of

the company. We also highlight that an unsatis-

factory conclusion of the engagement case may

ultimately lead to an exclusion from NAMs

portfolios.



Should the company not respond, we follow up in

regular increments. If the company remains unre-



sponsive or there is no positive progress on the

case around the 9 months mark, we will begin

using “lower” strength escalation tools, as de-

scribed in the escalation toolbox (please see 3.1.6.

for further elaboration of the tools at our

disposal).



If we cannot achieve positive momentum in our

engagement through the “lower” strength esca-

lation tools, we will consider “higher” strength

tools as well as present the case to RIC for re-

assessment. Ultimately, should these tools not

yield our expected change and positive progress,

the escalation track may lead to an exclusion

from NAMs portfolios.



After 18 to 24 months we aim to have received

clear communication by the company detailing

its approach to remediation or meeting the ob-

jectives we have set for the engagement. Finally,

we continue to monitor the case, the company’s

conduct and any new information that arises

before presenting a final evaluation of the case

and engagement to RIC.



Following the three years of engagement, we ex-

pect that a company has made meaningful pro-

gress towards our objectives which align with

remedying the breach, strengthening processes

and procedures to prevent reoccurrence etc. We

may continue the engagement on a “lower”

intensity to continuously monitor progress in

complex cases, where for example litigation or

longer drawn-out remediation may impact the

process.



While this process details the steps we take, indi-

vidual engagements may have different timelines

on a case-by-case basis given the complexities

and differences between engagements, the spe-

cific severity of impacts and the requirements for

a positive outcome.



Furthermore, depending on our relationship with

the company, the conduciveness and accessibility

of different escalatory steps, and our degree of

confidence in the company’s bona fide intentions,

the ultimate use of each element of the escala-

tion toolbox will be tailored on a case-by-case

basis.

3.2 Investment strategies



For a substantial part of our Nordea-branded

investment strategies, the application of ESG

tools goes beyond the requirements of the firm-

level policies described above. These strategies

are specifically made available to clients as

products promoted with ESG characteristics or,

where appropriate, as sustainable investment

products as defined by the SFDR.



For specific information on which additional ESG

features are integrated in the investment

decisions of a specific strategy, please refer to

our product-specific disclosures.



3.2.1 The STARS strategies: proven leadership

within responsible investment

Our STARS product range, which was launched

with the Swedish Stars Equity strategy in 2010

and Emerging Stars Equity strategy in 2011, today

covers a wide variety of asset classes. The STARS

range features deeper ESG integration and offers

direct, hands on cooperation between portfolio

managers and the Responsible Investment team.

Using NAM’s proprietary ESG scoring system and

bespoke analysis carried out by the Responsible

Investment team and financial analysts, the

STARS portfolios aim to outperform standard

benchmarks. Through product-specific, invest-

ment-led engagement with investee companies,

the portfolio managers and the Responsible

Investment team proactively leverage NAM’s

entire asset base to attempt to create positive

ESG impact, while seeking improved valuation

and excess return. More broadly, the investment

teams behind the STARS strategies focus on

selecting companies not only with sound funda-

mentals, but also with high ESG scores. Using the

SASB materiality map, the company analysis in-

cludes enhanced due diligence on environmental,

social and governance risks material to the inves-

tee company and considers how companies man-

age the identified ESG risks.



Furthermore, each company’s business model

alignment with the UN SDGs is taken into consid-

eration as the strategies’ exposure aims to skew

towards companies whose activities are net sup-

portive or neutral, rather than detracting, with

respect to the SDGs. ESG scores are recalibrated

regularly and at least annually or when triggered

by relevant negative or positive engagement re-

sults or news flows.



In addition to the positive selection described

above, the STARS strategies are also subject to a

number of formal exclusion criteria (see here)

and adhere to the PAFF. These will, rarely – if

ever – be triggered as companies subject to ex-

clusion would typically not be identified as in-

vestible in the first place.



Investment-led engagement is a key and distinc-

tive part of our investment approach for the

STARS strategies. Portfolio managers and the Re-

sponsible Investment team engage proactively

with companies in the STARS portfolios when we

see material ESG risks that may not be ade-

quately managed, or opportunities that may not

be fully capitalised on. We may also engage with

them to advance certain themes related to the

SDGs. Our engagement activities in the STARS

strategies are detailed in quarterly reports availa-

ble to our clients.



3.2.2 NAM’s thematic ESG strategies

Besides the STARS strategies, which invest

across a broad range of companies within their

given asset class, NAM offers a series of thematic

ESG strategies. These range from the seminal

Global Climate and Environment strategy

launched in 2008, to the Global Gender Diversity

strategy launched in 2019 and the Global Social

Empowerment strategy launched in 2021.

17



3/



NAM’s thematic ESG strategies apply proprietary

methods to identify companies that can be

expected to contribute to, or benefit from, the

ESG theme in question. Often, in-depth research

will reveal potential investee companies with

activities in areas that are not intuitively

associated with the theme of the strategy. For

example, the holdings of the NAM climate

strategy cover far broader ground than just the

traditional renewable energy industry and

related sectors usually associated with

combating or adapting to climate change. As is

the case for the STARS strategies, our thematic

ESG strategies benefit from hands on

involvement from the Responsible Investment

team and are subject to an enhanced ESG

exclusion regime, including the PAFF.



3.2.3 Enhanced exclusion filters

We understand that while many of our clients

may not choose to invest in a STARS or thematic

strategy, they may not wish to be exposed to

certain companies, sectors or practices, even

where there may be potential for improving

these companies’ behaviour through

engagement and/or the scope for asset

allocation in a portfolio is materially limited. For

this purpose, many of our other investment

strategies, including our multi-asset strategies,

are available with specific exclusion filters,

including the NAM Paris-Aligned Fossil Fuel

Policy, the so-called “NBIM list” of the Norwegian

Government Pension Fund Global and ethical

filters targeting sectors such as tobacco, alcohol,

gaming or pornography. In addition, some

strategies also feature targets for or limits on the

Investment Restrictions



Our investment restrictions stipulate thresholds that prohibits investment in

issuers operating in specific sectors and have involvement in activities.



These restrictions are continuously monitored in our internal limit monitoring system.6 Pre-trade limits

block the unfit investment opportunities and post-trade limits flag exposure or activity that is not aligned

with the investment restrictions, which may ultimately lead to divestment. Additional exclusions may apply

for certain investment strategies.



Climate change Coal Mining Companies with substantial and sustained exposure to coal mining with a 5%

revenue threshold on thermal coal and 30% revenue threshold on total coal (incl.

Metallurgical coal)7.

Companies with more than 50Mt annual production of thermal coal without a coal

phase out commitment8.



Coal-based

Electric Utilities

Electric utilities without commitment to phase-out coal by 2040 (35% revenue

threshold for advanced economies, 50% for others)9.

Companies with coal power expansion plans if existing coal power revenue exceed

10% or coal capacity exceed 5GW10.

Companies with coal expansion plans of \> 1 GW.



Oil Sand Companies with substantial and sustained exposure to oil sand with a 5% revenue

threshold.



Arctic Drilling Companies with exposure to oil and gas extraction through arctic drilling.



Human Rights Illegal

Weapons

NAM considers a range of weapon types, and their potential use, to be controversial,

given their indiscriminate effect on human populations. NAM does not invest in

companies that are involved in the production or development of cluster munitions,

anti-personnel mines, biological weapons, chemical weapons, weapons with non-

detectable fragments, incendiary and blinding laser weapons as well as depleted

uranium munitions.



Nuclear

Weapons

NAM does not invest in companies that are verified to be directly involved in produc-

tion or development of nuclear weapons. NAM also excludes companies involved in

the maintenance of nuclear weapons, with a military revenue threshold of 5%.



Soft

Commodities

Since 2012, NAM has not offered investment products where basic food commodities

such as wheat, coffee or sugar are included in the underlying assets.



6) Subject to data availability.

7) The threshold on metallurgical coal is higher as there are currently no widely available alternatives. Nevertheless, NAM has chosen

to apply a threshold and expects to adjust it downwards as applicable coal-free technologies appear, eg in the area of steel production.

8) A coal phase out commitment encompasses a public commitment to ending production of thermal coal or coalfired electricity

generation by 2040 latest.

9) Advanced economies are defined by IEA as the OECD regional grouping plus Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta and Romania.

10) Expansion plans includes projects that are announced, pre-permitted, permitted or under construction and which will result in new

coal-fired power capacity of at least 100 MW prorated.

Good Governance Sanctions NAM does not invest in sovereign bonds issued by governments that are subject to

relevant sanctions imposed by the UN, EU, USA or other applicable local regulators.



Pornography NAM does not invest in companies involved in the production or distribution of

pornography with a 5% revenue threshold.



Tobacco NAM does not invest in companies involved in the production of tobacco with a 5%

revenue threshold. The policy covers production of tobacco products such as cigars,

cigarettes, snus, as well as e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products.



Biodiversity Palm Oil NAM does not invest in palm oil producers11 that do not have an RSPO certification

target for their holdings and estates. Furthermore, companies which have an RSPO

target, but do not meet a minimum of 50% RSPO certification are also restricted12.



11) Palm oil producers are defined as having \>10% revenue threshold from palm oil.

ESG positions



Our ESG positions describe our broader expectations on our investee com-

panies in relation to topics such as climate change, good governance, human

rights and biodiversity. We encourage companies to comply with these ESG

positions and they may serve as a guide for our stewardship activities.



We take part in collaborative engagements, join investor initiatives and conduct research to, on a best

effort basis, ensure that our investee companies work towards living up to these positions. Depending on

the nature and gravity of individual cases, breaches can trigger engagement or exclusion.



Climate change

Climate change is one of the single largest threats to the global economy and in general to the conditions of all life on earth.



In addition, it implies specific risks to the companies and other entities we invest in. NAM is working on an ongoing basis to assess

climate change risks and the impact of the low-carbon transition on sectors and companies. Climate change presents a challenge to

our investments – in terms of its physical impact as well as through the prospect of radical policy measures and changing consumer

behaviour with the aim of reducing GHG emissions globally (transition risk). We expect companies exposed to climate risk:



• to have a strong climate governance and demonstrate how they integrate climate change challenges into their business

strategies, investment decisions and risk management

• to be able to disclose how their long-term business strategy and profitability will be impacted by a different regulatory and

physical environment

• to show how they identify and capitalise on opportunities related to climate change

• to be transparent with regards to their position on climate change regulation and interaction with regulators and policy makers

• to report in line with TCFD recommendations and act to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across their value chains in

accordance with the Paris Agreement



Methane Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, having contributed to around 30% of global warming since the

industrial revolution.13 As methane is a short-term climate forcer, 80 times more potent than CO2 over 20

years, reducing it provides critical short-term mitigation benefits and is a cost-effective mitigation

strategy for the oil and gas (O\&G) sector.14



We expect companies active in the O\&G sector to map methane mitigation actions, share their

cost/benefit analysis of these as well as ultimately achieve near-zero methane emissions as backed by

the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) Gold Standard reporting.15



Human Rights

While protecting and fulfilling human rights is a legal obligation and the responsibility of governments, it is widely recognised that

all businesses have the potential to impact human rights. Poor management conflicts with the long-term interest in promoting a

responsible and sustainable development and may impact companies’ license to operate.

5/



We expect companies to comply with internationally recognised human rights principles and to prevent and manage their impact on

human rights. Human rights-related issues include human rights abuses, modern slavery, fair living wage, and child labour,

occupational safety and health, the rights of indigenous people and displacement of local communities, freedom of association and

collective bargaining and international humanitarian law. Our expectations in these areas apply both to the investee companies

themselves and to their supply chains.



Conflict areas Business operations in areas affected by conflict are exposed to higher risk due to unstable political

conditions, weak regulatory frameworks and pervasive violence. Companies may, knowingly or

unknowingly, have business operations and products with a high potential impact on the conflict or

human rights violations.



As a responsible investor we expect companies to conduct due diligence as defined by the UN Guiding

Principles on Business Human Rights, become more transparent and report on their political risk and

impact analysis, including their human rights impact. Companies also need to assess and report on how

their business operations or products may directly or indirectly impact an ongoing conflict or human

rights violation and how this may have a material impact on the company as well as its stakeholders.

Companies should also enable stakeholders to safely report any human rights violations.



Indigenous

Rights – FPIC

We expect companies to respect Indigenous Peoples’ rights, as recognized by international principles

such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including by applying the principle of

Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) for activities that may impact them.



According to the definition by the UN, free implies that there is no coercion, intimidation or manipulation,

prior implies that consent is sought sufficiently in advance with respect shown to time requirements and

informed implies that information covers a range of aspects including nature, size, reversibility amongst

others, of any project and/or activity.16



Public Health –

Pharmaceutical

Pollution \& AMR



India’s pharmaceutical industry, expected to grow to USD 130 billion by 203017, contributes to the

country’s severe water pollution crisis caused by the waste generated in the manufacturing process.

Pharmaceutical pollution also drives antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is expected to cost USD 100

trillion18 and kill 10 million19 people by 2050. AMR has been declared one of the top ten global threats to

human health and is a systemic risk that may impact investment portfolios, economic stability and

broader society. Without access to effective antimicrobials, public health and the foundation of modern

medicine is being undermined.



We expect investee companies in the health care sector and pharmaceutical industry to make efforts to

safeguard public health. This includes actions to adequately address pollution as well as AMR.



Just Transition The green transition and decarbonisation of the global economy relies on climate justice, balancing

economic, environmental and social factors and finding solutions for workers and communities. In this

context, a just transition refers to preserving human rights and mitigating adverse societal and environ-

mental impacts in the transition to a low-carbon economy.



As an investor committed to contributing to a green and just energy transition, we expect companies to

companies to disclose their approach to environmental and social challenges within the transition and

have amongst others, proper human rights due diligence processes in place.

Good governance

NAM’s ownership activities are aimed at promoting sustainable profitability and sound management of ESG risks and other risk types

in portfolio companies, in order to protect shareholder value and enhance long-term returns. Our active ownership tools include

voting, attending Annual General Meetings, representation on nomination committees and engagement with companies.



We believe that a sound corporate governance structure is essential for creating long-term shareholder value. The board of directors

and senior management are accountable to investors for protecting and generating value over the long term. We expect the board of

directors of investee companies to oversee and monitor the effectiveness of the company’s governance of environmental, social and

business ethics-related issues and risks and to protect shareholder rights. We engage with investee companies and use our vote on

numerous issues, including shareholder rights, board composition, remuneration and risk management.



We expect companies affected by these risks to ensure that they report on how they manage the related risks and impacts adequately.



Corruption The evidence of a correlation between corrupt business practices and negative effects on long-term

financial returns is growing. Corruption leads to significant business-related costs and market inefficiency

and hinders economic, political and social development. We expect companies to take a proactive

approach towards corruption and responsible payments and ensure that adequate measures are

implemented and transparency is being elevated.



Tax We recognise the importance of companies being accountable for and transparent about their tax

practices.



We expect our portfolio companies to have a tax policy that outlines the company’s approach to taxation

and how it aligns with the overall business strategy. We also expect companies to have a robust tax

governance and management framework in place, to pay taxes where economic value is created and to

provide country-by-country reporting.



ESG in

remuneration

Each Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that overall remuneration to executive management is

appropriate and reasonable, aligned with the strategy of the company and that it promotes a sound

performance for the company in the long term. We are in favour of variable compensation plans that are

based on clearly defined performance criteria and which include ESG criteria.



Diversity We expect a board to include a strong presence of independent non-executives members and to be

diversified on gender, experience, age and other factors. A board should preferably have at least 40% of

either gender.



Corporate

Lobbying

Companies may contribute to and take part in policy processes to shape regulation that affects their

business objectives as well as more broadly their activities, e.g. environmental goals.



We expect companies to carry out political engagement in a responsible manner in line with relevant

guiding principles and frameworks. Furthermore, we expect companies to be transparent in relation to

such engagement, including the rationale for supporting or opposing certain matters.

Biodiversity

Biodiversity loss is a systemic risk. Nature is being eroded at rates unprecedented in human history and we are facing the irreversible

loss of plant and animal species, habitats and vital crops. Biodiversity affects our food and medicine and our environment20.



The continuing loss of biological diversity will cost the global economy several trillion euros by 205021. We expect companies affected

by these risks to ensure that they report on how they manage the related risks and impacts adequately. NAM ́s approach to

Biodiversity and Nature are further described in our White paper on biodiversity and nature.



Deforestation Agricultural expansion is one of the main drivers of deforestation and the associated loss of biodiversity

and soft commodity-driven deforestation presents both sustainability and financial risks for companies in

a number of industries including food products, household products, textiles and apparel. We recognise

the vital role forests play in climate change mitigation, biodiversity protection and in supporting

livelihoods.



Therefore, we expect all relevant companies in our portfolio that are involved in the production, trade, use

or financing of forest-risk commodities, particularly palm oil, soya, timber and cattle products, to commit

to eliminating deforestation and the loss of other valuable ecosystems from their operations and supply

chains. Sufficient measures include, but should not be limited to, implementing a strong governance

framework which clearly articulates the board’s accountability for and oversight of deforestation risks and

ensures traceability of forest-risk commodities.



Water Water crises have been identified as the global risk that can be the most impactful in the next 10 years. By

2025 two thirds of the world’s population will be subject to water stress. Economic growth and climate

change are putting extreme pressure on groundwater and renewable surface water resources. Water

scarcity is an issue for a number of companies that we are invested in. Certain industry sectors have in

some geographical areas of operations a particularly high exposure to water risk. We expect companies in

the high-risk sectors to ensure that they address and manage their water risk adequately.



Sensitive Areas In line with our overall expectations on biodiversity and nature, we expect companies whose activities

(including products and services) may affect sensitive areas including Natura 2000 areas, UNESCO World

Heritage sites, Key Biodiversity Areas (‘KBAs’) as well as other protected areas specified by the European

Parliament and the Council, to take necessary precautions to mitigate their impact on these areas and

adequately lay out how they manage these risks and impacts.



In line with our PAI process under SFDR, we screen for activities which negatively affect sensitive areas

on a quarterly basis. Our Responsible Investments team analyses these cases before presenting the case

to RIC that decides on one of three recommendations: no action, engagement or exclusion.
