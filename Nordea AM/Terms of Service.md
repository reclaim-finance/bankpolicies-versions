1/Purpose and scope



Purpose



The Responsible Investment Policy (the “Policy”)describes the framework governing the approachof Nordea Asset Management (“NAM”) toresponsible investments. NAM has two ESGfocused committees with specific areas ofresponsibility:



• The Responsible Investment Committee(“RIC”) decides and monitors exclusions andengagements at investment level



• The ESG Committee secures the governanceof our ESG related methods and principles.An ESG Operational Forum facilitates discus-sions and secures alignment and coordina-tion on ESG matters across the NAM valuechain, ensuring that the relevant decisionsare brought to the ESG Committee forapproval. The ESG Committee is also respon-sible for the content of and adherence to thisPolicy

Both Committees include members from theSenior Executive Management team and arechaired by the head of NAM, who is also the CEOof Nordea Asset Management Holding AB.

Nordea Asset Management’s mission is to createreturns with responsibility by



• being ESG-proactive

• delivering excess returns

• offering access to the right assets

• demonstrating operational excellence andtransparency

• maintaining industry-leading risk andperformance management



By ESG-proactive we mean



• integrating environmental, social andgovernance factors into our investmentprocesses, taking into account both sides ofthe “double materiality”1

• actively engaging with our investeecompanies to ensure that they meet ourexpectations of sound ESG performance andcompliance with international norms

• offering a wide range of ESG solutions acrossall asset classes

• accepting the responsibility to act as anindustry leader within ESG/sustainability



1) The concept of double materiality refers to, on the one hand, those ESG/sustainability risks that are material to the financialperformance of an investee company or other entity, and, on the other, to the environmental and social impact of the activities of thesame company or entity. The two will typically be closely linked, but should not be conflated.

Scope



NAM, or NAM Holding, which is the assetmanagement subsidiary of Nordea Bank Abp,includes Nordea Investment Management AB(“NIM”) and Nordea Investment Funds S.A.(“NIFSA”). NIM is a Swedish investment firmauthorised to, inter alia, provide discretionaryportfolio management services, and NIFSA is amanagement company authorised by the CSSF(the Luxembourg FSA) to manage UCITS andalternative investment funds. Nordea Funds Ltd(“NF”), is a management company authorized bythe Finnish FSA.

This Policy applies to all our Nordea-brandedinvestment strategies, including all the active andpassive investment funds managed by NIFSAand NF.

The Policy does not apply to selecteddiscretionary mandates where the client hasopted out of the Policy.

Due to the nature of certain investments, such asderivatives and units in external funds, the Policymay also not apply to a limited type of underlyinginvestment, whilst applying at the level of theportfolio.

This Policy is reviewed and updated as requiredand at least annually.

2/Advocacy andmemberships



NAM became a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investments (the

“PRI”) in 2007 and has offered strategies with sectoral screening since 1988.

In 2019, NAM publicly committed to aligning ourinvestment strategies with the objectives of theParis Agreement. This means that we have along-term strategic objective to reduce thegreenhouse gas emissions impact of our invest-ments in line with the “well below 2°C” ambition,increase our investments based on climate-related opportunities and ensure that our invest-ment portfolios are resilient to climate-relatedrisks. Since 2020, we are a founding member ofthe Net Zero Asset Managers initiative.

Our Responsible Investment Policy aims toencourage the companies we invest in to supportthe United Nations Sustainable DevelopmentGoals (“SDGs”) and comply with internationalconventions and norms, including, but not limitedto:



•

•

•



•

•

•

•

•

•



•

•



United Nations Global CompactOECD Principles of Corporate GovernanceOECD Guidelines for MultinationalEnterprisesUniversal Declaration of Human RightsUN Guiding Principles on Business andHuman RightsChildren’s Rights and Business PrinciplesILO conventions on labour standardsRio Declaration on Environment andDevelopmentUN Convention on CorruptionConvention on Cluster Munitions

We support standardised and integrated report-ing, which incorporates material sustainabilityinformation with financial information and pro-vides consistent and comparable ESG data,preferably using the SASB framework or similar.We also support and promote the adoption of therecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”).

In this context, we actively engage with variousstandard-setters and stakeholders locally and in-ternationally. We are active members of the PRI,SASB, IIGCC, CDP, TPI, Finance for BiodiversityPledge and Investor Alliance for Human Rights.

Nordea Asset Management adheres to theESG4Real standard for a select number of fundsand complies with the certification criteriathrough the integration of exclusion, norm-basedscreening and active ownership into the invest-ment process.

3/Our responsibleinvestment approach



We believe that it is our fiduciary duty to deliver returns with responsibility.

NAM ́s responsible investment framework buildson the PRI. We strive to achieve ESG integrationspanning a range of products through five mainmechanisms:



•

•

•

•

•



norm-based screeningsustainability risk integrationNAM-level PAI considerationNAM-level exclusion listactive ownership and engagement

NAM has developed policies and procedures toensure that the companies we invest in meet ourexpectations of ESG performance and thatESG/sustainability risk is managed in our invest-ment processes. This is supported by a robustnorm-based screening process and principaladverse impact (“PAI”) 2 analysis. In addition, weconsider and take a stance on an ongoing basis,across our portfolios, on issues relating to climatechange, human rights, good governance and bio-diversity/water. All of the above inform our activeownership and engagement policy and ourexclusion list at the firm level – our “firm-leveloverlay”.

For a substantial part of our assets undermanagement, we aim to achieve deeper ESG in-tegration with hands on involvement of theResponsible Investment team in our STARS strat-egies and thematic strategies (including climate,social empowerment and gender diversity portfo-lios) and our internally developed ESG scoring of

investee companies. Many individual productsalso have sector-based or other exclusion criteriabeyond those implemented at the firm level.Given the size of NAM’s investment universeacross its various investment boutiques andstrategies, we use a range of external providersof ESG data as well as internal research and ourproprietary ESG scoring platform. These dataproviders and other data sources are assessed onan ongoing basis for data quality, coverage andother attributes.

As for all ESG-oriented asset managers and assetowners, the dilemma of choosing between en-gagement and exclusion is central for NAM. Theargument for exclusion rests on the need toclearly mark the limits of which corporate activityand/or behaviours are deemed acceptable andwhich are not. The argument for engagement, onthe other hand, recognises that the real-worldeffect of exclusion can be negligible, at least inthe short term. Whenever one market participantsells off a security, another, presumably withlower standards of propriety, is buying it. Thus, itcan be argued that retaining a security, engagingwith the company and – where applicable –voting at its AGMs, is more effective. Added com-plexity is introduced by the likelihood that exclu-sion by some investors may make a companywith substandard practices more open to theengagement efforts of the remaining owners andthus to improving its practices over a longertimeframe.

2) Principal adverse impact on entity-level is reported annually in accordance with the EU SFDR. Principal adverse impact indicators, asdefined by the EU SFDR, capture the environmental and social or “outward” part of the “double materiality”, as opposed to sustainabilityrisk, which captures the financial materiality of ESG issues to the valuation of a security.

At NAM we believe that there are activities andtypes of behaviour that cannot be reconciled withour mission of delivering returns with responsibil-ity. Companies exhibiting these on an ongoingbasis are excluded from our investment universe.There is a large category of economic activitieswhich on the one hand may contribute positivelyto one or more SDG, while potentially having anegative impact on others. Activities and compa-nies in this category are excluded from manyNordea-branded investment strategies (see be-

low for NAM’s strategy-specific approaches andour Paris-aligned Fossil Fuel Policy), while stillbeing investible for more traditional strategies.

Assuming that engagement is most effectivewhen it is supported by an implicit but clearly un-derstood threat of ultimate exclusion, we believethat this allows NAM to be more compelling in itsengagement, up to the point where the decisionis taken to exclude a company at the NAM firm-level.

3.1 NAM-level overlay



NAM ́s responsible investment framework com-prises the availability of ESG data to all portfoliomanagers as well as a baseline integration ofESG safeguards, such as norm-based screening,PAI consideration and a common exclusion list,governed by our Responsible Investment Com-mittee and implemented across our Nordea-branded investment strategies. In addition, allNAM’s internal investment boutiques take intoaccount sustainability risk as part of their port-folio management processes. The decisions takenin the RIC ensure that our Nordea-branded in-vestment strategies live up to NAM’s minimumESG requirements, independent of the individualstrategies’ specific ESG profiles.



3.1.1 Norm-based screening

Our Nordea-branded investment strategies aresubject to norm-based screening, which identifiescompanies that are allegedly involved inbreaches of international law and norms on envi-ronmental protection, human rights, labourstandards and anti-corruption. If a company isidentified in this screening process, an internalassessment of the company and the incident isinitiated. The assessment is conducted by theResponsible Investment team, which provides arecommendation to the RIC, upon which the RICdecides on actions to be taken. Typical actions in-clude engagement, quarantine or exclusion. Aquarantine implies that the holdings of NAMportfolios in the company concerned may not beincreased and a quarantine will in nearly all casesbe accompanied by direct engagement with the

company. The RIC may also conclude that theissue raised does not merit immediate action,either because it has already been resolved or itis judged to be minor/immaterial.



3.1.2 NAM-level PAI consideration

The environmental and social impact of the activ-ities of our investee companies is monitored onan ongoing basis, subject to data availability,using an internally-developed monitoring system.Companies identified as outliers on entity level,on one or more PAI indicators are analysedfurther by the Responsible Investment team anda recommendation for action is made to the RIC,in a process similar to the one described abovefor norm breaches. Additional PAI considerationcan take place at the individual investmentstrategy level. Our disclosure statement on theconsideration of principal adverse impact atentity-level can be found on our websites. Theprincipal adverse impact of our investments isreported annually in this statement.



3.1.3 NAM-level exclusion list

Recognising that some types of economic activityor corporate behaviour are not compatible withour mission of returns with responsibility, NAMmaintains a firm-level exclusion list that is ap-plied in accordance with the scope of this Policy.Any addition to – or removal from – the list is de-cided by the RIC.

NAM excludes companies involved in seriousbreaches of international norms whereengagement is deemed not to be possible oreffective, as discussed above. For example, weban investment in companies active in theproduction of controversial weapons, including –but not limited to – cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines as well as nuclear weapons.NAM excludes companies involved in productionor distribution of pornography and companiesinvolved in the production of tobacco with a 5%revenue threshold. NAM also does not invest incompanies deriving more than 5% of theirrevenues from thermal coal, and has additionalinvestment restrictions for power generationcompanies without coal phase out plans, or withcoal power expansion activity. In addition, NAMexcludes companies involved in the production offossil fuels from oil sands (5% revenue threshold)or through arctic drilling. A substantial and

growing part of our strategies is also subject toour Paris-aligned Fossil Fuel Policy (“PAFF”),which excludes companies involved in fossil fuelproduction, distribution or services if they do nothave a recognised strategy to achieve anemissions path that is consistent with the ParisAgreement’s goal 3.

For strategies where the PAFF is notimplemented as a hard exclusion criterion, thePAFF acts as guidance for engagement. ThePAFF criteria also inform the prioritisation of ourtop-down thematic engagements.

3) This analysis builds on data from the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI), among other sources. Information on the TPI can be found .here4) Nordea Asset Management always takes the best interest of the fund unit holders into consideration. To protect our fund unit holders,this exclusion list may from time to time not include all excluded issuers.

3.1.4 Active ownership and engagement

On behalf of our clients, we undertake a range ofengagement activities with investee companiesin order to encourage them to improve theirenvironmental, social and governance practices,including promoting a long-term approach todecision-making. Our active ownership tools

include voting, attending AGMs, standard setting,engagement with companies, and filingresolutions. Our engagement with investeecompanies falls into three main categories, whichcan overlap and be applied to a given companysimultaneously:

Bottom-up“Investment-led”Engagements

\- Proposed byinvestmentboutiques or RIanalysts

Thematic engagements may be undertaken ei-ther by NAM alone or in collaboration with otherasset managers and asset owners. Collaborativeengagements can take place within the frame-work of industry initiatives such as Climate Action100+, SASB, PRI, CDP or the Investor Alliance forHuman Rights or through ad hoc initiatives. NAMwill in some cases initiate and lead such ad hocinvestor alliances. NAM’s thematic engagementstypically concern issues under one of the core ar-eas of interest identified in NAM’s ESG approach:



•

•

•

•



climatehuman rightsgood governancebiodiversity/water



Investment-led engagements are initiated andexecuted at the individual strategy and invest-ment boutique level.



Norms engagements are triggered by allegationof norm breaches, PAI red flags or other seriousnegative news flows

In tandem with our direct engagement with com-panies, voting is undertaken at as many AGMs aspractically possible, prioritising votes related tothe four core areas listed above, while in generalinsisting that companies 1) act in the long-terminterest of shareholders, 2) safeguard the rightsof all shareholders, 3) ensure an efficient andindependent board structure, 4) align incentivestructures for employees with the long-terminterest of shareholders, 5) disclose informationto the public in a timely, accurate and adequatemanner and 6) ensure high social, environmentaland ethical standards and accountability.

For more information, please refer to the NIMEngagement Policy, the NIFSA CorporateGovernance Principles, and the NF CorporateGovernance Principles.

The quality of the engagement process is auditedby internal audit on a regular basis. NAM com-plies with a number of national and supra-national corporate governance codes.



Political engagement \- we may participate inactivities that can be considered as political en-gagement, such as providing feedback on regula-tions and expressing support to policy makersthrough public endorsement in investor state-ments. We may also conduct policy engagement,which are activities focused on public policydialogues with governments as well as publicauthorities on specific ESG issues. These activitiesalign with our core values and our strategy todeliver returns with responsibility.

These type of activities are subject to careful con-sideration and diligence. We always assess theappropriateness of an activity that could be con-sidered as political, before we decide to enterinto it, and always assess the potential impact ofsuch activity. Our activities focus solely on ESGissues, and do not intend to favour any specificpolitical party or ideology5 . We believe that ourparticipation in political activities can contributeto long-term value creation and have a positiveimpact on society.



3.1.5 How we integrate ESG

NAM has implemented several initiatives to sup-port ESG integration throughout the whole firm.Our investment boutiques have access to NAM’sproprietary ESG database and ESG analysis fromthe Responsible Investment team, as well as ESGdata from external data providers. NAM’s Risk \&Performance team has integrated information onportfolio ESG/sustainability risks in their dailyreport to the analysts and portfolio managers.

The Responsible Investment team conductsworkshops on ESG topics and provideswalkthroughs of developments, where differentuse-case-scenarios of the data are presented.

5) Whilst we are registered as a lobbyist in the United States as a prudent measure, we do not make political contributions nor engagein activities which would require such registration.

3.1.6 EscalationWhich tools are at our disposal?

Collaborative Engagement

We believe that joining forces with otherinvestors in engaging with companies is aneffective way to achieve successful engagementoutcomes. While we also engage individually, wesee collaborative engagements as an importantpart of our Active Ownership work. Engaging inthis way allows us to share views with otherindustry players, and to scale up the impact ofour engagements.



Stakeholder Engagement

Interacting or partnering with other stakeholderssuch as trade or industry organizations, NGOs,experts, standard setters and regulatory bodiescan be an efficient means of escalating anengagement.



Media and Events

Using different media channels, organizingwebinars and conferences to furtherengagements with companies or industries areanother method to escalate engagements andraise awareness.



Public Statements

We may individually or jointly with otherinvestors or organizations issue publicstatements to highlight our position on a key ESGtopic, our differing views or our expectations onbest practices and conduct.



Letters to CEO or Board of Directors

To make our voice heard at the highest levels in acompany and to underline our expectations onkey issues, we may send letters to either the CEO,the Board Chair, Independent Directors, or toindividual members of the Board, such as thosechairing specific committees, either individuallyor together with other investors. These letterscan be open or submitted in confidence.



Annual General Meetings

At AGMs, we can use our voting rights as well asthe overall meeting to influence the company,escalate an engagement or lay out our supportfor or opposition to specific issues and votableitems.

Proxy Voting: We aim to vote at all companies weare invested in and in order to do so we attendAGMs and use proxy voting. At the AGM we canuse our voting rights and power to support orvote against directors, items and shareholder andmanagement proposals. We can thus use ourvoting rights and power to influence companieson certain matters and to support and escalateour engagements.

AGM Communication: In addition to voting, wecan ask questions, express concerns or read outstatements (during the Q\&A or submittedbeforehand).

Pre-AGM Meetings: At pre-AGM meetingsinitiated by us or the company, we can discusscertain items on the ballot related to anengagement and discuss our voting intention andrationale with the company. These meetingsallow us to further highlight our position on keyissues and why we may be inclined to voteagainst management items or for specificshareholder resolutions.

(Co-)filing of Shareholder Resolutions: We mayfile or co-file shareholder resolutions with otherinvestors to put an expected change of behavioror disclosure up for vote at a company’s AGM.

To gather support for a shareholder proposalwhich we have co-filed, we can initiate investorcampaigns and/or file exempt solicitations.

Pre-declaration of voting intentions: We can alsopre-declare our voting intentions, for example viathe PRI voting platform, our own homepage orvia other channels.

12

3/



Quarantine

We may quarantine a company, meaningportfolio managers cannot increase their position,for all NAM funds or for a subset (for example inthe STARS, Responsible and Thematic ranges)should a controversy arise related to thecompany.

The quarantine will be kept in place until wehave reasonable grounds that the company isaddressing or remediating the issue. Should thisnot happen, we may ultimately exclude thecompany.



Exclusion

In cases of serious breaches of internationalnorms on environmental protection, humanrights, labor standards, anti-corruption, or othernorms, we may initiate an internal assessment ofthe company and the incident, with the ultimateoutcome potentially being exclusion across allNordea funds.

De facto exclusions may also be applied only forspecific types of funds, for example our STARS,Responsible and Thematic ranges.



13

3/



Our Escalation Process – Norms Engagements

While all engagements may be escalated, wefollow a clear, time-bound and delineated pro-cess for our ‘RIC Norms’ engagements. These en-gagements take place with companies that arealleged to be in breach of international norms orconventions or those involved in significant ESG-related incidents.

Using our data providers, we screen ourinvestment portfolio for companies which arealleged to be in breach of international norms orconventions. Should an allegation of a breach bedetected, our Responsible Investments teamassesses the case based on factors such asseverity, magnitude of impact, as well as thecompany’s degree of involvement and culpability.This assessment is presented to our ResponsibleInvestments Committee (RIC), which is chairedby Nordea Asset Management’s CEO andconvenes on a quarterly basis.

Following the presentation of the case to RIC, thecommittee may decide that a direct exclusion iswarranted or that the Responsible Investmentsteam should initiate an engagement related tothe breach to acquire further information and/ora commitment to remediation. If the matter isdeemed by RIC to be inconsequential, the com-mittee may also decide to take no further action.

If RIC decides that an engagement should beinitiated, we follow a clear process, with time-bound milestones that must be met. Dependingon the severity of the case, the response orresponsiveness of the company, as well asadditional information we receive during theengagement, we may decide to make use of theadditional escalation tools described in 3.16,quarantine or exclude the company.

Following the decision to engage, we contactthe company highlighting the alleged breach,and requesting a meeting with representatives ofthe company. We also highlight that an unsatis-factory conclusion of the engagement case mayultimately lead to an exclusion from NAMsportfolios.

Should the company not respond, we follow up inregular increments. If the company remains unre-



sponsive or there is no positive progress on thecase around the 9 months mark, we will beginusing “lower” strength escalation tools, as de-scribed in the escalation toolbox (please see 3.1.6.for further elaboration of the tools at ourdisposal).

If we cannot achieve positive momentum in ourengagement through the “lower” strength esca-lation tools, we will consider “higher” strengthtools as well as present the case to RIC for re-assessment. Ultimately, should these tools notyield our expected change and positive progress,the escalation track may lead to an exclusionfrom NAMs portfolios.

After 18 to 24 months we aim to have receivedclear communication by the company detailingits approach to remediation or meeting the ob-jectives we have set for the engagement. Finally,we continue to monitor the case, the company’sconduct and any new information that arisesbefore presenting a final evaluation of the caseand engagement to RIC.

Following the three years of engagement, we ex-pect that a company has made meaningful pro-gress towards our objectives which align withremedying the breach, strengthening processesand procedures to prevent reoccurrence etc. Wemay continue the engagement on a “lower”intensity to continuously monitor progress incomplex cases, where for example litigation orlonger drawn-out remediation may impact theprocess.

While this process details the steps we take, indi-vidual engagements may have different timelineson a case-by-case basis given the complexitiesand differences between engagements, the spe-cific severity of impacts and the requirements fora positive outcome.

Furthermore, depending on our relationship withthe company, the conduciveness and accessibilityof different escalatory steps, and our degree ofconfidence in the company’s bona fide intentions,the ultimate use of each element of the escala-tion toolbox will be tailored on a case-by-casebasis.

3.2 Investment strategies



For a substantial part of our Nordea-brandedinvestment strategies, the application of ESGtools goes beyond the requirements of the firm-level policies described above. These strategiesare specifically made available to clients asproducts promoted with ESG characteristics or,where appropriate, as sustainable investmentproducts as defined by the SFDR.

For specific information on which additional ESGfeatures are integrated in the investmentdecisions of a specific strategy, please refer toour product-specific disclosures.



3.2.1 The STARS strategies: proven leadershipwithin responsible investment

Our STARS product range, which was launchedwith the Swedish Stars Equity strategy in 2010and Emerging Stars Equity strategy in 2011, todaycovers a wide variety of asset classes. The STARSrange features deeper ESG integration and offersdirect, hands on cooperation between portfoliomanagers and the Responsible Investment team.Using NAM’s proprietary ESG scoring system andbespoke analysis carried out by the ResponsibleInvestment team and financial analysts, theSTARS portfolios aim to outperform standardbenchmarks. Through product-specific, invest-ment-led engagement with investee companies,the portfolio managers and the ResponsibleInvestment team proactively leverage NAM’sentire asset base to attempt to create positiveESG impact, while seeking improved valuationand excess return. More broadly, the investmentteams behind the STARS strategies focus onselecting companies not only with sound funda-mentals, but also with high ESG scores. Using theSASB materiality map, the company analysis in-cludes enhanced due diligence on environmental,social and governance risks material to the inves-tee company and considers how companies man-age the identified ESG risks.

Furthermore, each company’s business modelalignment with the UN SDGs is taken into consid-eration as the strategies’ exposure aims to skewtowards companies whose activities are net sup-portive or neutral, rather than detracting, withrespect to the SDGs. ESG scores are recalibratedregularly and at least annually or when triggeredby relevant negative or positive engagement re-sults or news flows.

In addition to the positive selection describedabove, the STARS strategies are also subject to anumber of formal exclusion criteria (see here)and adhere to the PAFF. These will, rarely – ifever – be triggered as companies subject to ex-clusion would typically not be identified as in-vestible in the first place.

Investment-led engagement is a key and distinc-tive part of our investment approach for theSTARS strategies. Portfolio managers and the Re-sponsible Investment team engage proactivelywith companies in the STARS portfolios when wesee material ESG risks that may not be ade-quately managed, or opportunities that may notbe fully capitalised on. We may also engage withthem to advance certain themes related to theSDGs. Our engagement activities in the STARSstrategies are detailed in quarterly reports availa-ble to our clients.



3.2.2 NAM’s thematic ESG strategies

Besides the STARS strategies, which investacross a broad range of companies within theirgiven asset class, NAM offers a series of thematicESG strategies. These range from the seminalGlobal Climate and Environment strategylaunched in 2008, to the Global Gender Diversitystrategy launched in 2019 and the Global SocialEmpowerment strategy launched in 2021.

16

3/



NAM’s thematic ESG strategies apply proprietarymethods to identify companies that can beexpected to contribute to, or benefit from, theESG theme in question. Often, in-depth researchwill reveal potential investee companies withactivities in areas that are not intuitivelyassociated with the theme of the strategy. Forexample, the holdings of the NAM climatestrategy cover far broader ground than just thetraditional renewable energy industry andrelated sectors usually associated withcombating or adapting to climate change. As isthe case for the STARS strategies, our thematicESG strategies benefit from hands oninvolvement from the Responsible Investmentteam and are subject to an enhanced ESGexclusion regime, including the PAFF.



3.2.3 Enhanced exclusion filters

We understand that while many of our clientsmay not choose to invest in a STARS or thematicstrategy, they may not wish to be exposed tocertain companies, sectors or practices, evenwhere there may be potential for improvingthese companies’ behaviour throughengagement and/or the scope for assetallocation in a portfolio is materially limited. Forthis purpose, many of our other investmentstrategies, including our multi-asset strategies,are available with specific exclusion filters,including the NAM Paris-Aligned Fossil FuelPolicy, the so-called “NBIM list” of the NorwegianGovernment Pension Fund Global and ethicalfilters targeting sectors such as tobacco, alcohol,gaming or pornography. In addition, somestrategies also feature targets for or limits on thecarbon footprint/intensity relative to benchmark,a targeted minimum ESG score, or a targetedlevel of EU taxonomy alignment.

17

4/Investment Restrictions



Our investment restrictions stipulate thresholds that prohibits investment inissuers operating in specific sectors and have involvement in activities.



These restrictions are continuously monitored in our internal limit monitoring system.6 Pre-trade limitsblock the unfit investment opportunities and post-trade limits flag exposure or activity that is not alignedwith the investment restrictions, which may ultimately lead to divestment. Additional exclusions may applyfor certain investment strategies.



Climate change Coal Mining Companies with substantial and sustained exposure to coal mining with a 5%revenue threshold on thermal coal and 30% revenue threshold on total coal (incl.Metallurgical coal) 7 .Companies with more than 50Mt annual production of thermal coal without a coalphase out commitment 8.



Coal-basedElectric Utilities

Electric utilities without commitment to phase-out coal by 2040 (35% revenuethreshold for advanced economies, 50% for others) 9.Companies with coal power expansion plans if existing coal power revenue exceed10% or coal capacity exceed 5GW 10.Companies with coal expansion plans of \> 1 GW.



Oil Sand Companies with substantial and sustained exposure to oil sand with a 5% revenuethreshold.



Arctic Drilling Companies with exposure to oil and gas extraction through arctic drilling.



Human Rights IllegalWeapons

NAM considers a range of weapon types, and their potential use, to be controversial,given their indiscriminate effect on human populations. NAM does not invest incompanies that are involved in the production or development of cluster munitions,anti-personnel mines, biological weapons, chemical weapons, weapons with non-detectable fragments, incendiary and blinding laser weapons as well as depleteduranium munitions.



NuclearWeapons

NAM does not invest in companies that are verified to be directly involved in produc-tion or development of nuclear weapons. NAM also excludes companies involved inthe maintenance of nuclear weapons, with a military revenue threshold of 5%.



SoftCommodities

Since 2012, NAM has not offered investment products where basic food commoditiessuch as wheat, coffee or sugar are included in the underlying assets.

6) Subject to data availability.7) The threshold on metallurgical coal is higher as there are currently no widely available alternatives. Nevertheless, NAM has chosento apply a threshold and expects to adjust it downwards as applicable coal-free technologies appear, eg in the area of steel production.8) A coal phase out commitment encompasses a public commitment to ending production of thermal coal or coalfired electricitygeneration by 2040 latest.9) Advanced economies are defined by IEA as the OECD regional grouping plus Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta and Romania.10) Expansion plans includes projects that are announced, pre-permitted, permitted or under construction and which will result in newcoal-fired power capacity of at least 100 MW prorated.

Good Governance Sanctions NAM does not invest in sovereign bonds issued by governments that are subject torelevant sanctions imposed by the UN, EU, USA or other applicable local regulators.



Pornography NAM does not invest in companies involved in the production or distribution ofpornography with a 5% revenue threshold.



Tobacco NAM does not invest in companies involved in the production of tobacco with a 5%revenue threshold. The policy covers production of tobacco products such as cigars,cigarettes, snus, as well as e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products.



Biodiversity Palm Oil NAM does not invest in palm oil producers11 that do not have an RSPO certificationtarget for their holdings and estates. Furthermore, companies which have an RSPOtarget, but do not meet a minimum of 50% RSPO certification are also restricted12 .

11) Palm oil producers are defined as having \>10% revenue threshold from palm oil.12) RSPO: Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.

19

5/ESG positions



Our ESG positions describe our broader expectations on our investee com-panies in relation to topics such as climate change, good governance, humanrights and biodiversity. We encourage companies to comply with these ESGpositions and they may serve as a guide for our stewardship activities.

We take part in collaborative engagements, join investor initiatives and conduct research to, on a besteffort basis, ensure that our investee companies work towards living up to these positions. Depending onthe nature and gravity of individual cases, breaches can trigger engagement or exclusion.



Climate changeClimate change is one of the single largest threats to the global economy and in general to the conditions of all life on earth.

In addition, it implies specific risks to the companies and other entities we invest in. NAM is working on an ongoing basis to assessclimate change risks and the impact of the low-carbon transition on sectors and companies. Climate change presents a challenge toour investments – in terms of its physical impact as well as through the prospect of radical policy measures and changing consumerbehaviour with the aim of reducing GHG emissions globally (transition risk). We expect companies exposed to climate risk:



•



•



•

•

•



to have a strong climate governance and demonstrate how they integrate climate change challenges into their businessstrategies, investment decisions and risk managementto be able to disclose how their long-term business strategy and profitability will be impacted by a different regulatory andphysical environmentto show how they identify and capitalise on opportunities related to climate changeto be transparent with regards to their position on climate change regulation and interaction with regulators and policy makersto report in line with TCFD recommendations and act to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across their value chains inaccordance with the Paris Agreement



Methane Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, having contributed to around 30% of global warming since theindustrial revolution. 13 As methane is a short-term climate forcer, 80 times more potent than CO 2 over 20years, reducing it provides critical short-term mitigation benefits and is a cost-effective mitigationstrategy for the oil and gas (O\&G) sector.14

We expect companies active in the O\&G sector to map methane mitigation actions, share theircost/benefit analysis of these as well as ultimately achieve near-zero methane emissions as backed bythe Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) Gold Standard reporting. 15



Human Rights

While protecting and fulfilling human rights is a legal obligation and the responsibility of governments, it is widely recognised thatall businesses have the potential to impact human rights. Poor management conflicts with the long-term interest in promoting aresponsible and sustainable development and may impact companies’ license to operate.

We expect companies to comply with internationally recognised human rights principles and to prevent and manage their impact onhuman rights. Human rights-related issues include human rights abuses, modern slavery, fair living wage, and child labour,occupational safety and health, the rights of indigenous people and displacement of local communities, freedom of association andcollective bargaining and international humanitarian law. Our expectations in these areas apply both to the investee companiesthemselves and to their supply chains.



Conflict areas Business operations in areas affected by conflict are exposed to higher risk due to unstable politicalconditions, weak regulatory frameworks and pervasive violence. Companies may, knowingly orunknowingly, have business operations and products with a high potential impact on the conflict orhuman rights violations.

As a responsible investor we expect companies to conduct due diligence as defined by the UN GuidingPrinciples on Business Human Rights, become more transparent and report on their political risk andimpact analysis, including their human rights impact. Companies also need to assess and report on howtheir business operations or products may directly or indirectly impact an ongoing conflict or humanrights violation and how this may have a material impact on the company as well as its stakeholders.Companies should also enable stakeholders to safely report any human rights violations.



IndigenousRights – FPIC

We expect companies to respect Indigenous Peoples’ rights, as recognized by international principlessuch as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including by applying the principle ofFree, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) for activities that may impact them.

According to the definition by the UN, free implies that there is no coercion, intimidation or manipulation,prior implies that consent is sought sufficiently in advance with respect shown to time requirements andinformed implies that information covers a range of aspects including nature, size, reversibility amongstothers, of any project and/or activity. 16



Public Health –PharmaceuticalPollution \& AMR



India’s pharmaceutical industry, expected to grow to USD 130 billion by 203017 , contributes to thecountry’s severe water pollution crisis caused by the waste generated in the manufacturing process.Pharmaceutical pollution also drives antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is expected to cost USD 100trillion 18 and kill 10 million 19 people by 2050. AMR has been declared one of the top ten global threats tohuman health and is a systemic risk that may impact investment portfolios, economic stability andbroader society. Without access to effective antimicrobials, public health and the foundation of modernmedicine is being undermined.

We expect investee companies in the health care sector and pharmaceutical industry to make efforts tosafeguard public health. This includes actions to adequately address pollution as well as AMR.



Just Transition The green transition and decarbonisation of the global economy relies on climate justice, balancingeconomic, environmental and social factors and finding solutions for workers and communities. In thiscontext, a just transition refers to preserving human rights and mitigating adverse societal and environ-mental impacts in the transition to a low-carbon economy.

As an investor committed to contributing to a green and just energy transition, we expect companies tocompanies to disclose their approach to environmental and social challenges within the transition andhave amongst others, proper human rights due diligence processes in place.

Good governance

NAM’s ownership activities are aimed at promoting sustainable profitability and sound management of ESG risks and other risk typesin portfolio companies, in order to protect shareholder value and enhance long-term returns. Our active ownership tools includevoting, attending Annual General Meetings, representation on nomination committees and engagement with companies.

We believe that a sound corporate governance structure is essential for creating long-term shareholder value. The board of directorsand senior management are accountable to investors for protecting and generating value over the long term. We expect the board ofdirectors of investee companies to oversee and monitor the effectiveness of the company’s governance of environmental, social andbusiness ethics-related issues and risks and to protect shareholder rights. We engage with investee companies and use our vote onnumerous issues, including shareholder rights, board composition, remuneration and risk management.

We expect companies affected by these risks to ensure that they report on how they manage the related risks and impacts adequately.



Corruption The evidence of a correlation between corrupt business practices and negative effects on long-termfinancial returns is growing. Corruption leads to significant business-related costs and market inefficiencyand hinders economic, political and social development. We expect companies to take a proactiveapproach towards corruption and responsible payments and ensure that adequate measures areimplemented and transparency is being elevated.



Tax We recognise the importance of companies being accountable for and transparent about their taxpractices.

We expect our portfolio companies to have a tax policy that outlines the company’s approach to taxationand how it aligns with the overall business strategy. We also expect companies to have a robust taxgovernance and management framework in place, to pay taxes where economic value is created and toprovide country-by-country reporting.



ESG inremuneration

Each Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that overall remuneration to executive management isappropriate and reasonable, aligned with the strategy of the company and that it promotes a soundperformance for the company in the long term. We are in favour of variable compensation plans that arebased on clearly defined performance criteria and which include ESG criteria.



Diversity We expect a board to include a strong presence of independent non-executives members and to bediversified on gender, experience, age and other factors. A board should preferably have at least 40% ofeither gender.



CorporateLobbying

Companies may contribute to and take part in policy processes to shape regulation that affects theirbusiness objectives as well as more broadly their activities, e.g. environmental goals.

We expect companies to carry out political engagement in a responsible manner in line with relevantguiding principles and frameworks. Furthermore, we expect companies to be transparent in relation tosuch engagement, including the rationale for supporting or opposing certain matters.

Biodiversity

Biodiversity loss is a systemic risk. Nature is being eroded at rates unprecedented in human history and we are facing the irreversibleloss of plant and animal species, habitats and vital crops. Biodiversity affects our food and medicine and our environment20.

The continuing loss of biological diversity will cost the global economy several trillion euros by 2050 21 . We expect companies affectedby these risks to ensure that they report on how they manage the related risks and impacts adequately. NAM ́s approach toBiodiversity and Nature are further described in our White paper on biodiversity and nature.



Deforestation Agricultural expansion is one of the main drivers of deforestation and the associated loss of biodiversityand soft commodity-driven deforestation presents both sustainability and financial risks for companies ina number of industries including food products, household products, textiles and apparel. We recognisethe vital role forests play in climate change mitigation, biodiversity protection and in supportinglivelihoods.

Therefore, we expect all relevant companies in our portfolio that are involved in the production, trade, useor financing of forest-risk commodities, particularly palm oil, soya, timber and cattle products, to committo eliminating deforestation and the loss of other valuable ecosystems from their operations and supplychains. Sufficient measures include, but should not be limited to, implementing a strong governanceframework which clearly articulates the board’s accountability for and oversight of deforestation risks andensures traceability of forest-risk commodities.



Water Water crises have been identified as the global risk that can be the most impactful in the next 10 years. By2025 two thirds of the world’s population will be subject to water stress. Economic growth and climatechange are putting extreme pressure on groundwater and renewable surface water resources. Waterscarcity is an issue for a number of companies that we are invested in. Certain industry sectors have insome geographical areas of operations a particularly high exposure to water risk. We expect companies inthe high-risk sectors to ensure that they address and manage their water risk adequately.



Sensitive Areas In line with our overall expectations on biodiversity and nature, we expect companies whose activities(including products and services) may affect sensitive areas including Natura 2000 areas, UNESCO WorldHeritage sites, Key Biodiversity Areas (‘KBAs’) as well as other protected areas specified by the EuropeanParliament and the Council, to take necessary precautions to mitigate their impact on these areas andadequately lay out how they manage these risks and impacts.

In line with our PAI process under SFDR, we screen for activities which negatively affect sensitive areason a quarterly basis. Our Responsible Investments team analyses these cases before presenting the caseto RIC that decides on one of three recommendations: no action, engagement or exclusion.
