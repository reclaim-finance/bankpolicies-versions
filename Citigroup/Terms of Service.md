Citi’s Sustainability Journey



Citi has been engaging in sustainability and environmental initiatives for more than two decades, andwe continue to advance our leadership and partnerships across the industry.

Environmental and Social Policy Framework | 5



Citi’s Approach to Climate Change



Climate change is one of the most critical challenges facing our global society and economy in the21st century. The data is irrefutable, and the world’s climate scientists agree that urgent action mustbe taken to address the current and potential impacts of climate change, including chronic changesto temperature and precipitation, rising sea levels, and more intense and frequent extreme weatherevents. Some of these impacts are already being felt in communities across the globe, and longer-term climatic changes have the potential to cause wide-ranging impacts affecting business andsociety, including disrupted supply chains, damaged infrastructure, reduced crop yields and a declinein biodiversity. These risks and impacts are exacerbated by inequality and unsustainable economicdevelopment, which put additional pressure on land, water, forests and other natural resources.These interconnected challenges endanger the vitality of communities all over the world and presenta threat to global prosperity if not managed properly. The financial sector has an important role toplay in addressing this challenge by supporting the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economythat balances the environmental, social and economic needs of society. Citi understands these criticalsustainability issues and believes we must respect and support the environment and human rights inour operations, supply chain and client transactions.

We also understand the complexity of developing solutions to these challenges, which require acombination of strong governmental policy and regulatory frameworks, corporate leadership, investorengagement and individual actions. As one of the largest financiers of carbon-intensive sectors suchas energy, power and industrials, we know that the ambition to bring our business into alignment withthe ambitions stated in the Paris Agreement will not be easy. Moreover, aligning the global economywith the Paris Agreement will require rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy systems, industrialprocesses, land-use, buildings, transport and other infrastructure, all supported by an enabling policyenvironment. We also know that delaying this transition could increase the costs, lock in carbon-emitting technology and infrastructure, increase the risks of stranded assets and reduce the rangeof effective responses to the challenge in the medium and long term. In light of these opportunitiesand risks, in 2021 we announced our intent to achieve net zero GHG emissions associated with ourfinancing by 2050 and net zero for our own operations by 2030. For details on our Net Zero Plan andthe underlying interim targets, please see our climate reporting.

Achieving a low-carbon economy will also require increased financing of climate solutions. Buildingon our previous $50 billion climate initiative from 2007-2013 and our $100 billion environmentalfinance goal from 2014-2019, in 2021 Citi announced a commitment to $1 trillion in sustainablefinance by 2030. This commitment extends our previous environmental finance goal from $250 billionand includes environmental and social criteria such as renewable energy, sustainable transportationand circular economy as well as affordable housing, economic inclusion, education, food securityand healthcare.

More than 20 years of working with clients, partners, employees and other key stakeholders toaddress the growing risks and opportunities related to climate have positioned us to respond to thischallenge. We have participated in or contributed to the development of market-based frameworks,such as the Equator Principles, Green Bond Principles, the Poseidon Principles, the PegasusGuidelines, Sustainable Aluminum Finance Framework, and the Sustainable STEEL Principles, and arereporting Citi’s financed emissions for certain carbon intensive sectors per the Partnership for CarbonAccounting Financials (PCAF) Standard, and supporting the development of evolving methodologiesfrom PCAF and the market to enhance understanding of financed and facilitated emissions1. We know



1 96% Financed emissions are the GHG emissions generated by the operations and entities that financial institutions lend money to or invest in.

6 | Environmental and Social Policy Framework



there is more to do and we will continue to learn, engage and report on our progress, but we cannot doit alone. We support responsible and interconnected governmental action on climate to alignincentives across the economy to support a low-carbon future, including robust approaches to carbonpricing and disclosure of climate risks.

Citi’s Net Zero Commitment



In March 2021, we announced our intent to achieve net zero GHG emissions associated with ourfinancing by 2050 and net zero for our own operations by 2030. Our Net Zero Plan provides thefoundation for us to implement our goal of achieving our net zero commitment. Our Net Zero Plan issummarized in the graphic below. Details on each of the elements in this plan, our interim 2030targets for select sectors, and our year-on-year progress toward meeting our net zero objectives areavailable in our 2023 Citi Climate Report.

Sustainable Operations



Citi remains committed to reducing the environmental footprint of our facilities around the world. As ofDecember 2023, we have facilities across 95 countries. Our global operations give us an opportunity topositively impact the communities where we live and work.

For our operations, we are targeting net zero emissions by 2030. Additionally, we set 2025Operational Footprint goals, which help drive performance improvements related to greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions, energy use, water consumption, waste reduction and diversion, and sustainablebuilding design. These goals are aligned with a pathway to limit global temperature rise to 1.5O C.Our efforts to further integrate sustainable practices across our geographic footprint also includerenewable electricity sourcing, employee engagement and seeking opportunities for efficiency inbusiness travel. Citi also purchases voluntary third-party verified carbon credits consisting of aportfolio of nature-based, energy efficiency and methane destruction credits in an amount equivalentto our Scope 1 direct GHG emissions. Progress toward these operational footprint goals is provided inour annual ESG reporting.

Sustainable Finance



The financial sector has an important role to play in helping to address climate change by providingaccess to the capital needed for the transition to a low-carbon economy.

We have committed $1 trillion to sustainable finance by 2030 to finance and facilitate a wide array ofclimate solutions, such as renewable energy, clean technology, water conservation and sustainabletransportation and in social finance, which includes activity in affordable housing and basicinfrastructure, diversity and equity, economic inclusion, education, food security and healthcare. Our$1 trillion goal aims to support the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy that balancessociety’s environmental, social and economic needs.



Tracking Progress



Each transaction we finance or facilitate must meet at least one of our criteria for environmental orsocial finance to be counted toward the overall $1 trillion goal. These criteria were informed by externalstandards and may therefore be subject to changes as industry guidelines are further developed.Definitions of our environmental finance and social finance criteria are included below.

We track our sustainable finance activities using third-party financial league table credit, whereapplicable. The industry league tables track public financial activities and rank financial institutionsbased on their role (i.e., lead arranger, bookrunner, etc.) in each transaction. For financial productsfor which there are no established league tables, we count the amount that reflects Citi’s financialinvolvement in the deal.

For additional details on progress toward our $1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Goal, please see ourannual ESG reporting.

Environmental and Social Policy Framework | 9



Human Rights



Citi supports the protection and fulfilment of human rights around the world and is guided byfundamental principles of human rights, such as those in the U.N. Universal Declaration of HumanRights2 and the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles andRights at Work (including the fundamental core conventions)3 . We engage with a range of stakeholdersto support our efforts to respect human rights in line with the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business andHuman Rights — a global framework for preventing and addressing the risk of adverse impacts onhuman rights linked to business activity. To learn more about our commitment to human rights andour approach to human rights protections see our Statement on Human Rights.

Environmental and Social Risk Management



Citi lends and mobilizes billions of dollars of capital toward a variety of companies and projects,including sectors that may be associated with environmental and social impacts and risks. Beforemaking a financing decision, our Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) Policy guidesour assessment of these risks and impacts. We then engage with our clients as they work to applyinternational standards and responsible industry practice to mitigate and manage environmental andsocial risks which can generate credit, reputation and/or legal risks to Citi.

Citi’s global ESRM Policy, which is regularly updated in response to emerging risks, applies across thefirm any time one of the following criteria is met:

1. A transaction is above relevant financial thresholds for the financial product type that has anidentified use of proceeds directed to a specific physical asset or project

2. Clients or transactions covered by one of Citi’s ESRM sector- specific requirements (see page 14-18), or

3. Transactions that trigger one of the ESRM Areas of High Caution (see page 12-14).



Exclusionary Criteria

Financing for projects specifically focused on the following activities are not eligible toward the$1 trillion goal:

• Large scale hydropower plants that have a generation capacity of over 25 MW, unless the projecthas lifecycle GHG emissions intensity of no greater than 100g CO2 /kWh or power density of atleast 5 W/m²• Fossil fuel projects, including:– Refined or alternative coal technologies– Gas-to-liquid projects– Natural gas projects

2 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 and is widely regarded as the internationalcommunity’s fundamental human rights framework. The rights it recognizes are implemented in international law by the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966). As explained inthe Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we also recognize that other international instruments can inform the responsibility torespect, particularly those articulating the rights of vulnerable groups.3 The ILO core conventions cover the freedom of association and collective bargaining, elimination of forced and compulsory labor, eliminationof discrimination, abolition of child labor, and a safe and healthy working environment.

10 | Environmental and Social Policy Framework



ESRM Policy Implementation



Implementation of the ESRM Policy is a shared responsibility across Citi business and risk teamsglobally when any of the above listed policy triggers apply.

Updates to the ESRM Policy are reviewed by internal governance forums or committees and subjectto review and challenge. Application of the ESRM Policy is subject to internal controls to ensureadherence by Citi businesses. Citi policy governance allows requests for exceptions in exceptionalcases, with reasons for the exception clearly articulated and a formal request sent to the Policy Owner.



Risk Screening of Transactions



When potential transactions are first referred to the ESRM unit, we start by evaluating if it fallswithin the scope of the ESRM Policy. We work to identify any relevant environmental and social risksassociated with the proposed transaction and based on the risks identified determine whether anyadditional due diligence or client engagement is required in order to move forward. As one part ofa holistic review and approval process for all transactions and client relationships covered underthe ESRM Policy, Citi considers a client’s commitment, capacity and track record related to itsenvironmental and social performance.

Risk Screening for Project- Related Transactions



Our approach to project-related transactions is informed by internationally recognized standards andframeworks including those articulated by the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation(IFC) and the Equator Principles. At the marketing stage for project-related transactions, the ESRMunit works closely with bankers to categorize the magnitude of potential impacts associated with atransaction using criteria in part defined by the IFC and to screen for any environmental or social risksassociated with the transaction. These categories include:



• Category A — use of proceeds is likely to have potential significant adverse social or environmentalimpacts that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented;



• Category B — use of proceeds is likely to have potential limited adverse social or environmentalimpacts that are few in number, generally site-specific, largely reversible and readily addressedthrough mitigation measures; and



• Category C — use of proceeds is expected to have minimal or no social or environmental impacts.

The chart in the Appendix provides an illustrative summary of steps taken in a typical Citi project-related finance transaction.

For projects in countries who are not members of the Organization of Economic Cooperationand Development (OECD), Citi requires benchmarking against the relevant IFC sector-specificEnvironmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines, which address topics including, but not limitedto, pollution prevention and abatement and worker and community health and safety, as well as theissue-based IFC Performance Standards, which include:



• PS 1 — Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts



• PS 2 — Labor and Working Conditions



• PS 3 — Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention

Environmental and Social Policy Framework | 11



• PS 4 — Community Health, Safety and Security



• PS 5 — Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement



• PS 6 — Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources



• PS 7 — Indigenous Peoples



• PS 8 — Cultural Heritage

For transactions in high-income OECD countries, Citi requires compliance with all relevant localand national environmental laws, such as those on impact assessment, public consultation andstakeholder engagement processes, and permitting conditions. Furthermore, we evaluate projects inthese countries against relevant responsible industry practice.



Independent Review



All Category A and certain higher risk Category B project finance and project-related corporate loansrequire review by an independent environmental and/or social expert with relevant expertise, notassociated directly with the borrower. Independent Review may also be required of other ESRM highrisk transactions or client relationships, especially those involving Areas of High Caution (see page12-14). Independent Review contributes to Citi’s due diligence by reviewing the environmental andsocial assessment documentation and consultation process documentation, assessing ESRM Policyalignment, identifying gaps and proposing corrective actions to fill those gaps.



Action Plans



Following either ESRM internal review or Independent Review, if gaps are identified between a client’scurrent plans or operations and ESRM Policy requirements, an Environmental and Social Action Plan(ESAP) is developed. The ESAP contains targeted environmental and social actions with timelines anddeliverables to demonstrate completion that bring the project into alignment with the ESRM Policyover a reasonable timeframe. In project-related loans, the ESAP becomes a binding covenant of theloan agreement and alignment with it is monitored, either by an independent consultant or by theclient’s environmental team members, with results reported to Citi on a regular basis.



Policy Prohibitions



Citi does not do business with companies when our due diligence indicates that they are active in thefollowing activities, which we have determined expose Citi to unreasonably high risk:



• Production or activities involving modern slavery, human trafficking or forced labor, defined as allwork or service, not voluntarily performed, that is extracted from an individual under threat of forceor penalty;



• Production or activities involving harmful or exploitative forms of child labor. Harmful child labormeans the employment of children that is economically exploitive, or is likely to be hazardous to,or interfere with, the child’s education, or be harmful to the child’s health, or physical, mental,spiritual, moral or social development;



• Illegal logging;



• Production or trade in any product or activity deemed illegal under the host country laws or

12 | Environmental and Social Policy Framework



regulations (including those ratified by host countries under international conventionsand agreements);



• Production or trade in wildlife or products regulated under CITES (the Convention on InternationalTrade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora);



• Drift net fishing in the marine environment using nets in excess of 2.5 km in length;



• Production or shipment of cluster munitions.

Furthermore, please refer to the ESRM sector-specific requirements and Areas of High Caution foradditional project-related requirements.

Areas of High Caution



Consistent with the precautionary principle of “do no harm,” Citi recognizes that there are certainAreas of High Caution that require special attention, focus and respect due to heightened risks whichmay also subject Citi to associated credit, reputation and legal risks. These Areas of High Cautionapply where these risks are identified, regardless of financial product or sector. Citi only proceedswith transactions that impact such Areas of High Caution after a careful review of impacts and risks,and confirmation that mitigation measures have been or will be designed to align with internationalresponsible industry practice. Where applicable, Citi considers relevant national laws and internationalstandards such as the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and, for emergingmarkets, the IFC Performance Standards.

In addition, in project-related transactions where these risks are present, Independent Review ofsocial and environmental assessment documentation by a qualified independent consultant withthe relevant expertise may be required, as determined by the ESRM unit, to evaluate whether risksand impacts are being appropriately managed. These Areas of High Caution include the followingthematic areas.



High Biodiversity Risk



Biodiversity refers to the variability, complexity and interdependence of species and ecosystems onland and in the ocean. Biodiversity risk analysis considers the potential impacts activities can have onthe health and integrity of global biodiversity and ecosystem services. This risk is of particular concernin areas of high biodiversity with critical habitat to support species and/or areas of high conservationvalue, such as those found in the Amazon rainforest, other tropical rainforests, Ramsar Wetlands,mangroves, etc. In addition, biodiversity degradation and deforestation exacerbate the problem ofclimate change. Transactions with high biodiversity risk require close review of the client’s biodiversitymanagement. For project-related lending in non-OECD countries, this includes assessment of projectbiodiversity management plans against IFC Performance Standard 6 on biodiversity and naturalresource management. Citi will not finance mining projects that utilize submarine waste disposal dueto heightened risks.



Significant Cultural Heritage Value



Cultural heritage encompasses properties and sites of archaeological, historical, cultural, artistic, and/or religious significance. It also refers to unique environmental features and cultural knowledge, as wellas intangible forms of culture embodying traditional lifestyles that should be preserved for current andfuture generations. Projects or transactions that may impact cultural heritage require close review by

Environmental and Social Policy Framework | 13

the ESRM unit. Citi will not finance projects that negatively impact UNESCO World Heritage Sites.



Project-Related Conflict Risk



Project development in sectors with large land requirements, such as mining, oil \& gas andagribusiness, may trigger conflict due to land conversion needs. This need for resources and land mayalso trigger company-community conflict presenting risk to rights holders. In these project-relatedfinancing cases, Citi carefully considers key conflict factors such as sources of tension, root causesof conflict, different stakeholders’ perspectives and motivations, and ability to address such risks.In addition, projects in fragile and conflict-affected areas present risk in the management of projectsecurity, for example mining projects involving “conflict minerals.” In these cases, we recommend ourclients use the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights as guidance for managing theirengagement of security forces.



Elevated Human Rights Risks



Certain risk factors in client activities can lead to elevated human rights risks that require specialattention and enhanced human rights due diligence. Some factors that may increase human rightsrisks include activities or projects:



• In countries or regions with both the presence of significant vulnerable populations and witha history of known human rights abuses relevant to the sector. Vulnerable groups may haveincreased difficulty in adapting to changes brought by projects and may not have access toadequate protection, respect and remedy for their human rights, and thus significant presence ofthese groups in the project area of influence increases the social risks;



• In countries or regions with a history of known human rights abuses related to the sector and weakenforcement of labor laws, especially occupational health and safety and freedom of association;



• Involving in-migration of large labor forces, which can lead to a higher risk of human trafficking orforced labor;



• With environmental justice concerns due to disproportionate adverse environmental or healthimpacts on racial or ethnic minority communities, or economically disadvantaged communities;



• Related to constructing or operating private prisons.

Indigenous Peoples



Citi recognizes and respects the unique historical treatment and collective rights of IndigenousPeoples, and understands that these communities’ languages, beliefs, cultural values and landsare often under threat, representing a higher degree of vulnerability than other project-affectedcommunities. Citi will use extra caution and conduct enhanced due diligence (which may requireIndependent Review by a qualified social expert) when the transaction may pose adverse effects to:



• An area used or traditionally claimed by an Indigenous community;



• Their communal self-preservation based on traditional ways of life; or



• Their use or enjoyment of critical cultural heritage that is essential to their identity and/or thecultural, ceremonial or spiritual aspects of their lives.

14 | Environmental and Social Policy Framework



Building upon government efforts, companies must not infringe upon the rights and protectionsfor Indigenous Peoples contained in relevant national law, including those laws implementing hostcountry obligations under international law. Globally, in project-related lending for projects involvinginvoluntary resettlement of indigenous communities, significant impacts on land and naturalresources traditionally used by the community, or significant impacts on critical cultural heritage,project sponsors are expected to have engaged in meaningful consultation with directly affectedIndigenous Peoples, with the goal of achieving Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC).



Large-scale Resettlement



All transactions involving large-scale resettlement or displacement of people require special attentionand enhanced due diligence.



Sector- Specific Requirements



Citi recognizes that there are a number of important areas that require increased attention via sector-specific standards or guidance as described below to help mitigate heighted environmental and socialrisks and associated credit, reputation and/or legal risk. Citi’s sector-specific requirements apply atthe client relationship level regardless of financial product or threshold.



Agribusiness



We review agribusiness clients within the scope defined in the subsectors below for direct and supplychain deforestation or land conversion risks, commitments to strong environmental and social policies,relevant sustainability certifications, and/or supply chain traceability programs. As part of thesereviews, the external standards Citi refers to in the subsectors below address a number of Citi’s Areasof High Caution such as biodiversity risk, human rights risks, and the respect and protections for theunique cultural values and vulnerability of Indigenous Peoples in activities that affect their territoriallands and livelihoods.



Forestry



Citi requires environmental and social risk assessments prior to onboarding and at annual review for allforestry clients that are directly involved in logging or primary processing of timber from either naturalforests or plantations. We review all forestry clients’ policies, practices and track record on forestrymanagement to evaluate alignment with responsible industry practice, including labor, communityengagement, systems to avoid deforestation or land conversion of high conservation value and highcarbon stock forests, and proper prevention of fire risk. To help mitigate associated risks, all forestryclients operating in tropical forests are required to be members of the Forestry Stewardship Council(FSC) and commit to a time bound action plan to achieve FSC certification within three to five yearsof client onboarding or new land acquisition, which includes establishing management systemsconsistent with the principles of No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation. FSC certification maybe required in other geographies if concerns of impacts to high conservation value forests are identifiedthereby increasing risk. Forestry clients are reviewed annually by Citi to confirm ongoing certificationstatus and management practices. Citi also has a long-standing public commitment not to engage inbusiness with companies that we know to be in violation of local or national forestry and logging laws.If any forestry client is unable or unwilling to pursue the required certification or undertake correctiveactions, ESRM would escalate the relationship to the relevant risk committees for consideration to exitthe relationship.

Environmental and Social Policy Framework | 15



Palm Oil



Citi is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a respected globalmultistakeholder forum setting environmental and social criteria for the palm oil industry. We havelong required all palm oil clients involved in the upstream production of palm oil (e.g., growers andmills) to become members of the RSPO. These clients must commit to a time-bound action plan toachieve full RSPO certification within three to five years of becoming a Citi client. Downstream palmoil refiners and traders are reviewed for RSPO membership, zero deforestation policies, as well aslinks to Areas of High Caution in their supply chain and encouraged to obtain RSPO certification ifrelevant. Citi ESRM team monitors progress annually on alignment with RSPO Principles and Criteriato ensure palm oil clients’ operations are consistent with the principle of No Deforestation, No Peatand No Exploitation. We evaluate our clients’ identification and preservation of high conservationvalue areas (including peatlands and high carbon forests), implementation of responsible industrypractice fire prevention and management systems, adherence to international labor standards, and theimplementation of FPIC for project-affected communities. Any palm oil producer client who has notachieved certification by 2025 will be escalated to the Head of ESRM and relevant risk committees forconsideration to exit the relationship.



Soy



The production of soy presents risks of deforestation and biodiversity loss in sensitive ecoregionsacross South America, including the Amazon Forest, the Cerrado tropical savanna, the Atlantic Forestand the Gran Chaco Forest. To address these risks, clients that are soy producers in these countries,or processors and traders who source from these countries, must be escalated to the ESRM unitto understand if their operations overlap with sensitive ecoregions. Clients that are identified asproducing in or sourcing from the above ecoregions will be reviewed for membership and certificationwith the Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS) or equivalent environmental and social managementsystems to address deforestation. Existing clients in these ecoregions who are not already certifiedwill be encouraged to pursue RTRS membership or other relevant certifications. New clients in theseecoregions will be evaluated for membership and certification of RTRS or equivalent certification witha goal of working toward full certification.



Beef



The beef industry can act as a driver of deforestation and land clearance in biodiverse ecoregionsof Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru. Citi evaluates clients directlyinvolved in cattle rearing, fattening and finishing in these countries, as well as slaughterhouses andmeat processing plants sourcing from these countries, to determine if their operations or supplychains overlap sensitive ecoregions – specifically the Amazon Forest, the Cerrado tropical savanna,the Pantanal grasslands and the Gran Chaco Forest. For these clients, Citi reviews their policies andmanagement plans for clear commitments to 100% traceability of their supply chain in alignment withthe Accountability Framework Initiative. This framework provides guidance based on internationalnorms and responsible industry practices for companies to prevent deforestation driven by theproduction of agricultural commodities, including livestock, in their operations and supply chains.Citi reviews these clients annually and encourages time-bound improvement in alignment andtraceability commitments.

16 | Environmental and Social Policy Framework

Coal



As a carbon intensive energy source, global alignment with a low-carbon economy calls for a rapidtransition away from thermal coal as a fuel source. This trend increases the risk of stranded assetswhich leads to increased credit risk related to financing coal.



Coal Mining



Citi will not provide project-related financing for new thermal coal mines or significant expansion ofexisting mines, and has set targets to phase out our financing of mining companies deriving ≥25% oftheir revenue from thermal coal mining:



• By the end of 2025, we will reduce our credit exposure to these companies by at least 50% from a2020 baseline;



• After 2025, we will no longer facilitate capital markets transactions or mergers and acquisitionadvisory and financing for these companies;



• By the end of 2030, all remaining exposure to these companies will be reduced to zero.

Approval for any transaction for a coal mining company requires escalation for review of the company’stransition away from coal.



Coal-fired Power Generation



Citi is committed to helping our Power clients transition to a Paris Agreement-aligned future. Globally,Citi will not provide project-related financial services for transactions supporting the construction orexpansion of coal-fired power plants, including refinancing recently constructed plants. This includestransactions supporting the supply of all components, equipment, materials and services directlyrequired for the construction of such plants.

In addition, in line with our net zero targets we have established a set of increasing expectations overtime for our clients with coal-fired power generation.

Citi expects clients with coal-fired power generation to:



• Publicly report their GHG emissions annually consistent with the GHG Protocol; and



• Engage with Citi as requested on their low-carbon transition strategy to diversify away from coal-fired power generation. It is our expectation that such strategies will align with Paris Agreementdecarbonization pathways by 2030 (for clients with power generation in OECD countries) and by2040 (for clients with power generation in non-OECD countries).

Furthermore, Citi commits to:



• Not provide acquisition financing or acquisition advisory services related to coal-fired powerplants. Exceptions may be considered if the proposed transaction is being pursued in the contextof a low-carbon transition strategy or managed phaseout.



• Not onboard any new clients with ≥20% of power generation from coal-fired power plants unlesssuch client meets the above criteria; i.e., is pursuing a low-carbon transition strategy.

Environmental and Social Policy Framework | 17



• Not onboard any new clients that have plans to expand coal-fired power generation.

After 2025, Citi commits to:



• No longer extend capital and/or provide other financial services to clients that do not have alow-carbon transition strategy to diversify away from coal-fired power generation and align withParis Agreement decarbonization pathways by 2030 (for clients with power generation in OECDcountries) or by 2040 (for clients with power generation in non-OECD countries). Exceptions maybe considered, with escalated senior management review, for regulated utilities or state-ownedentities that are not able to decarbonize in line with the policy due to legal and/or regulatoryrequirements, or if the proposed transaction is being pursued in the context of a low-carbontransition strategy or managed phaseout.



• Not onboard any new clients with a material business line in power generation unless they alignwith a Paris Agreement decarbonization pathway as described above.

After 2030, Citi commits to:



• For clients with power generation operations in OECD countries, no longer extend capital and/orprovide other financial services unless the share of power generation from coal-fired power plantsis less than 5%.



• For clients with power generation operations in non-OECD countries, no longer extend capitaland/or provide other financial services unless such clients have a low-carbon transition strategythat is designed to reduce the share of power generation from coal-fired power plants to lessthan 5% by 2040.

Commercial Firearms



Citi is committed to promote the adoption of responsible industry practices with our applicablebusiness relationships regarding the manufacture, distribution and retail sale of firearms. Thiscommitment is designed to respect the rights of responsible gun owners and the responsiblebusinesses that serve them, while promoting community and individual safety. In pursuit of this goal,Citi requires U.S. Firearms Retailers and Firearms Manufacturers who sell through U.S. retail channelsto conform to responsible practices regarding the sale of firearms. For retailers, these responsiblepractices include only selling firearms to individuals who have passed a completed background checkwith a “Proceed” response; placing additional requirements on the sale of firearms to individuals under21 years of age (such as firearms training as active or former military or law enforcement, or successfulcompletion of a gun safety or hunter safety training by a certified instructor); and not selling bumpstocks or high-capacity magazines (e.g., for long guns, magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, andfor hand guns, magazines that either extend beyond the bottom of the pistol grip or attach outside ofthe pistol grip, and hold more than 10 rounds). For manufacturers, this entails ensuring that they sellfirearms and ammunition only through retail channels that follow the retailer responsible practicesidentified by the policy.



Military Equipment



Citi will not directly finance the production, distribution or sale of cluster munitions, biological orchemical weapons, or nuclear weapons. In the rare case where we may be asked to provide directfinancing of the production or shipment of other military equipment such as munitions, missiles,

fighter aircraft, armored vehicles or warships, escalation and senior consultation is required todetermine if allowed.



Nuclear Power



Citi recognizes the complexities involved in the responsible management of nuclear power. Project-related transactions will be evaluated against host-country environmental laws, regulations, andpermits, and in emerging markets, against the international nuclear environmental guidelines that areset forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and IFC standards. Construction of newnuclear power plants will be subject to independent review by qualified consultants.



Oil and Gas



The oil and gas sector presents a number of sensitive environmental and social risks that must becarefully assessed to evaluate whether companies’ policies and management approach align withresponsible industry practice. Our due diligence approach to any project-related transaction in thissector includes the risk management policy implementation (see Risk Screening for Project- RelatedTransactions on page 10 or the appendix) and focuses on oil and gas sector-specific risks such asemergency response and spill response plans, methane and other emissions management, and theexperience and operational track record of the company, prior to making a decision whether to proceed.

Beyond project-related lending, the ESRM unit evaluates the risk profile of oil \& gas clients basedon the geographic locations of their assets, the risks associated with their activities (such as frontierexploration, oil sands, LNG terminals, midstream pipelines, developments in sensitive areas), potentialoverlaps with ESRM’s Areas of High Caution, any patterns of regulatory violations or safety incidents,and large-scale community opposition or litigation related to environmental or social issues.

Citi does not provide project-related financial products or services to oil and gas exploration,development or production in the Arctic Circle due to heightened risks including elevated operationalrisk, technical complexity, credit risk, and environmental risk. In addition, Citi does not provideproject-related financial products or services for expansion of oil and gas operations in the Amazondue to sensitive biodiversity risks in the region and heightened risks. Any general corporate purposestransaction for clients with operations in the Amazon requires enhanced ESRM due diligence.

Supply Chain



Citi strives to maintain sustainable practices in its supply chain. Suppliers must adhere to allapplicable laws and comply with Citi’s Requirements for Suppliers which communicate relevant Citipolicies and mandate, among other requirements, supplier policies and practices designed to prohibitdiscrimination in the workplace and address the risk of forced labor, child labor or other indicators ofmodern slavery.

Citi’s Statement of Supplier Principles outlines aspirational guidelines in the areas of ethical businesspractices, human rights in the workplace and environmental sustainability which it encourages itssuppliers to maintain.

Citi maintains a process to identify risks related to its suppliers, including risks of modern slavery.Through this Corporate Responsibility Questionnaire process, Citi also seeks information fromsuppliers on sustainability-related matters addressed in the Statement of Supplier Principles.
