Coal and Unconventional Oil \& Gas Sector Exclusion 4



1\. Scope of application of the Policy



This GIAM Coal and Unconventional Oil \& Gas Sector Exclusion Policy applies to direct investment transactionsconcerning listed and unlisted equity and debt instruments issued by the corporate entities meeting the exclusioncriteria, performed by GIAM in the provision of both the individual portfolio management service as well as thecollective asset management of the Collective Investment Schemes (CIS).

In terms of asset classes, bank deposits (i.e., time and cash deposits) and derivatives transactions are excludedfrom the scope of application of this Policy.

In the context of the individual portfolio management service and collective asset management under adelegation agreement, GIAM can agree with its Clients / delegating management company to apply additionalexclusions, each time Clients/Delegating management company require GIAM to apply their own exclusionpolicies and such policies are more restrictive than GIAM’s one. Conversely, in case such exclusion policies areless restrictive than GIAM’s one, GIAM reserves itself the right of not accepting any such less restrictive policies,

on a case-by-case basis.



1.2 APPROVAL AND REVIEW



GIAM Board of Directors has approved this Policy upon proposal of GIAM CEO, who is also in charge forensuring the implementation of the Policy.

Any possible review of the policy remains subject to approval by the BoD. This Policy is regularly reviewed andupdated with the support of the ESG Integration \& Solutions, having regard to possible changes to the regulatory

requirements, GIAM’s organization or business, the way in which GIAM conducts business (e.g. changes to the

distribution model) and internal regulations. The reviewed version then of the Policy is submitted to the BoD forapproval by the GIAM CEO.

The updated version of the Policy is published on GIAM’s website.

2\. Coal Sector



Overall progress towards the Paris Agreement goals requires a “steep reduction” in the use of coal, the main

factor responsible for climate change attributable to human activity.

The IPCC states that coal-fired electricity generation must be reduced to near-zero in all climate scenariosconsistent with limiting warming to 1.5 °C. Further, combustion of thermal coal needs to be reduced by 75%from 2010 levels by 2030, and by 98-100% by 2050.

According to the Science Based Targets (SBT), for financial institutions to phase out financial support to coalacross all their activities in line with a full phaseout of coal by 2030, they need to immediately cease all financialor other support to coal companies, that are building new coal infrastructure or investing in new or additionalthermal coal expansion, mining, production, utilization (i.e., combustion), retrofitting, or acquiring of coal assets.

According to Climate Analytics, between 2030 and 2040 all the regions should phase out of coal. The firstregions to phase out are the OECD, Eastern Europe and Former Soviet Union countries - by 2031, followed byLatin America by 2032, Middle East and Africa by 2034, and finally non-OECD Asia by 2037, completing a globalcoal phase-out before 2040.

According to IEA (International Energy Agency), in a new scenario to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 (calledNet Zero Emissions by 2050 - NZE2050), the share provided by coal plants without CCUS will fall sharply from37% in 2019 to 6% in 2030 (with the share of renewables in global electricity supply rising from 27% in 2019 to60% in 2030 and nuclear power generates just over 10%).

With this policy, GIAM commits to reducing to zero the exposure to coal of all business lines by 2030 in Europeanand OECD countries, and by 2040 in the rest of the world.GIAM commits to strengthening the exclusion criteria and thresholds regularly to end all support to companiesactive in the coal sector by the above-mentioned dates.



2.1 COAL SECTOR EXCLUSION



GIAM identifies companies as potential exclusion if one or more of the following criteria occurs:



 Coal-related business: more than 20% of the revenues deriving from coal;

 Coal power generation: more than 20% of power generated from coal;

 Companies with an installed coal power capacity of more than 5 GW.

In addition, GIAM committed to increase the level of scrutiny by applying two additional stringent criteria:



 Coal mining: more than 10 Million Tons of Coal production per year.

 Companies involved in coal mining and power expansion projects.

At every annual screening, the companies involved in thermal coal business are reanalyzed to verify if there areelements to reinclude any company in the investable universe. If the analyzed company no longer triggers thethresholds defined for exclusion, the company exits the Coal Restricted List.



Exceptions and Engagement



The coal exclusion list is formed using the thresholds defined in this Policy. The ESG I\&S function may considergranting exceptions to issuers which are close to the exclusion thresholds and that have a credible energy-mixtransition plan away from coal. The exceptions would follow an ad-hoc assessment of the materiality andcredibility of the coal-phase out plans. A SBT (Science Based Target), even if not exclusively focus on the coalphase out plans, can be considered as a credible decarbonization plan as well as a commitment to reducing tozero the exposure to coal of all business lines by 2030 in European and OECD countries, and by 2040 in therest of the world (in line with GIAM coal exit strategy), accompanied by public updates, disclosures and dialoguewith investors compatible with a clear reduction path.

In the event that more information is required to assess the coal phase out strategy, the companies will beengaged. If the engagement efforts do not lead to obtaining more relevant information on a time horizon of 9months, the companies will be considered as restricted.

3\. Unconventional Oil and Gas Sector



GIAM commits to no longer make new investments in companies involved in the exploration and production offossil fuels from Tar Sands. Effective January 2023, GIAM is extending the exclusion policy both to issuersinvolved in exploration and production of oil and gas extracted by fracking (shale oil, shale gas, tight oil, tightgas) and to issuers with onshore and offshore exploration and production activities that fall within the ArcticCircle.

Particularly, GIAM will not invest in companies:



Fossil fuels from Tar Sands

 with more than 5% of revenues derived from Tar Sands exploration and production;

 operating controversial pipeline dedicated to the transport of Tar Sands.



Oil and gas extracted by Fracking

 with more than 10% of revenues derived from fracking exploration and production.



Oil and gas from the Arctic Circle

 with more than 10% of revenues derived from Oil and Gas exploration and production from Artic Circle.



The identification of the restricted companies is carried out according to the information sourced by externalESG data providers. For issuers or sub-set of information not completely covered by MSCI, data can becomplemented by other publicly available ESG data sources and/or investee companies’ public disclosure or

information shared through the engagement relationship.

At every annual screening, the companies involved in Unconventional Oil \& Gas businesses are reanalyzed toverify if there are elements to re-include any company in the investable universe. If the analyzed company nolonger triggers the criteria defined for exclusion, the company exits the restricted list.

4\. Process



The list of restricted issuers is defined by the ESG Integration \& Solutions according to the above-indicated Coaland Unconventional Oil \& Gas Sector exclusion criteria.

ESG data providers enable to identify the issuers not compliant with the screening criteria. GIAM identifies MSCIas the reference data provider. For issuers or sub-set of information not completely covered by MSCI, data can

be complemented by other publicly available ESG data sources and/or investee companies’ public disclosure

or information shared through the engagement relationship.

On an annual basis, the ESG Integration \& Solutions function sends the list of restricted issuers to theInvestments function for screening and immediate application purposes, as well as to the Risk Managementfunction for monitoring purposes. The list is applied to all managed relevant portfolios as regard the financialinstruments falling under the scope of application of this Policy,

The list is then integrated into GIAM’s investment tools, as outsourced to Generali Investments Holding, usedby portfolio managers in order to be flagged by blocking alerts.



For those companies identified as restricted the following actions apply:



 No new investments are allowed; the list of restricted issuers is integrated in GIAM’s investment

management system that prevents the possibility for the portfolio managers to insert orders on any suchissuers;

 For existing exposure: the relevant portfolio manager can decide, in the best interest of the managedportfolio and depending on the type of financial instruments concerned, to(i) hold to maturity(ii) perform opportunistic sales, depending on the individual case and considering potentialconstraints (e.g., balance sheet constraints, potential P\&L impact for Group andPolicyholders, market liquidity conditions, Asset and Liability Management constraints, RiskManagement limits).
