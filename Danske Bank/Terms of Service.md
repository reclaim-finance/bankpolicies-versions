Position Statementon Fossil Fuels

2

Our approach to the fossil fuels sector



Danske Bank aims to be a responsible partner in thetransition towards a low-carbon economy. Assuming thisresponsibility, we have developed clear standards forour engagement with the fossil fuels sector with the ParisAgreement as our principal guideline. We have outlined ouroverall roadmap to net zero in our Climate Action Plan.



This position statement describes the approach wetake to the fossil sector and outlines the key restrictions,expectations and recommendations we apply with regards

to the encompassed financing services and investment

products. It is also central to our strategic focus areas tosupport customers in their transition, ensure a robust bankand manage our societal impact. The position statement

takes into consideration the work of leading intergovernmental

institutions such as the International Energy Agency and the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.



Relevant definitions



Relevant definitions include:• Fossil fuels are defined as a class of hydrocarbon

containing materials of biological origin occurring withinthe Earth’s crust that can be used as a source of energy,including coal, petroleum, natural gas, oil shales, peat, tar

sands and heavy oils.• Unconventional oil and gas are defined as tar sands and

shale extraction/hydraulic fracturing

• Tar sands are a form of unconventional petroleum

deposit consisting of a mixture of sand, clay, water andbitumen.

• Hydraulic fracturing is an unconventional drilling

technique whereby it is possible to extract oil and gasfrom shale by injecting liquid at high pressure.

• Frontier oil and gas production is defined as production in

ultra-deep sea, the Arctic or the Amazon Basin

• Danske Bank defines the Arctic as • everything north ofthe Arctic Circle (latitude 66.55° north of the equator).

• Ultra-deep-sea drilling refers to drilling deeper than

1500 metres below surface level.• Expansion of oil and gas refers to any activity intended

to expand the supply of oil and gas beyond that which

was approved for development1 by 31 December 2021.

Expansion thereby also covers amending current approvalsto increase supply beyond that which was approved fordevelopment by 31 December 2021.

• Expansion of coal refers to building new coal mines,

extending existing mines or to expanding coal-fired

product capacity beyond that which was in operation by31 December 2021.



Financing services position

Scope

The restrictions stipulated in the financing position statementapply to financing services, here defined as lending, guarantees,primary debt and equity capital markets activities.

Project finance is defined as the financing of the construction

of, and normally the subsequent operation of, large energy,

infrastructure and production facilities projects. Project finance

is a long-term structured funding arrangement in which debt

repayment is primarily reliant on the project’s cash flows

upon completion, with no or limited recourse to the project’sshareholders.



Regarding value chain coverage, the restrictions on coaland peat apply to utility companies. For coal specifically, the

restrictions also apply to extraction by metals and miningcompanies. For oil and gas, it applies to all companies within

the Exploration \& Production (E\&P) segment. E\&P companiesare defined as companies that explore for and produce oil or

natural gas from sub-surface basins onshore or offshore. The

definition covers pure-play companies, integrated companies,NOCs, INOCs, independents and majors. This does not includecompanies in the upstream value chain that provide services

to the E\&P companies, including but not limited to drilling

companies, service companies, seismic companies and/

or engineering companies. While these non- encompassed

companies have a critical role in discovering resources, theyare not the ultimate decision-makers on the investmentsneeded to convert resources into reserves.



Restrictions

Coal and peat

Danske Bank will phase out companies with coal- and peat-

fired power generation and heating from its financing product

portfolios by 2030.

Danske Bank will not

• provide financing services to thermal coal mining

companies

• provide financing service to companies that generatemorethan 5% of their combined revenues from coalfired and/or peat-fired power generation and heating or companiesthat expand coal-fired or peat-fired power generation and

heating2

• participate in project finance for unabated fossil fuels



1 For details, please see the IEA, ’Net Zero Roadmap: A Global Pathway to Keep the 1.5 °C Goal in Reach’2 Reopening of coal-fired or peat-fired power plants mandated by the company’s government to ensure energy availability is not taken to be expansion.

Oil and gas

Danske Bank will not

• provide financing services to oil and gas E\&P companies

that do not set a credible transition plan in line with the

Paris Agreement. This includes a long-term 2050 net-

zero goal, ambitious short- and medium-term reductiontargets on scope 1 and 2 emissions and a material scope3 emission reduction target. In addition, it includes acommitment to not expand supply of oil and gas beyond

that which was approved for development by 31 December

2021.

• participate in project finance for unabated fossil fuels• provide long-term financing or refinancing to E\&Pcompanies that generate more than 5% of their revenuesfrom unconventional or frontier oil and gas

The lending restrictions are reflected in the Credit Policy of

Danske Bank. The policy and underlying instructions andtools further steer the implementation and monitoring of

the restrictions. All credit cases are reviewed for potentialbreaches of the Credit Policy, and cases that raise concernsare escalated for further review.



Exemptions to financing restrictions

Danske Bank makes exemptions for companies for the

following reasons:1. Danske Bank may provide financing services to companiesencompassed by these restrictions if the financing is ring-

fenced for renewable energy or carbon capture, utilisation

and storage (CCUS) activities.2. For the provision of financing services, exemptions can bemade to the restriction of providing financing services tocompanies that generate more than 5% of their combinedrevenues from coal-fired and/or peat-fired power generation

and heating if the company has a credible 2030 phase-outplan. We may make exemptions to allow the inclusion ofcertain instances of peat or coal in power- generation andheating as some older boilers are built for partial peat orcoal combustion. These select cases would need to meetthe thresholds set out in this position statement.

3. In cases of M\&A activity, our customer’s exposures

towards fossil fuels can change at short notice. If exposureschange due to e.g. acquisitions, we will assess the long-term planning of these companies and expect these plansto be aligned with the Paris Agreement.



Investment position



Danske Bank will in 2024 initiate the implementation of an

updated approach to fossil fuel investments.



The implementation will be carried out in accordance withapplicable sector legislation and will at all times be within theboundaries of regulatory requirements. The implementationwill be carried out in stages in accordance with applicable

governance.



This section outlines the future position, once fully

implemented, for fossil fuels in respect to our investments.



Scope

Externally managed investment and pension products

distributed to Danske Bank and Danica Pension through our

platforms are also not in scope. Additional investment

products may, due to unforeseen implementation issues, alsobe deemed to be out of scope.



Regarding value chain coverage, fossil fuel companies aredefined, as outlined in the Exclusion Instruction, ascompanies that derive more than 5% of total revenues fromhydrocarbons through exploration, production, refining,transportation, storage, energy equipment and services, and

power generation.



The data used to identify such companies comes from ISS-

ESG.



Restrictions
