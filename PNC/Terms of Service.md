JOINT STATEMENT FROM



While we’ve grown in size and capabilities, we’ve remained true to our values —doing business with integrity and respect, centering our customers in all that we do,focusing on teamwork and performance, and fostering an environment in which ourcustomers and employees feel welcomed, valued and respected.

This belief in serving the best interests of all our stakeholders, along with ourcorporate values, shapes how we do business.

This Responsible Lending Practices disclosure reflects our integrated approach toEnvironmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) and outlines our multilayeredframework, providing transparency to the practices we employ in making businessdecisions. We strive to make lending decisions that balance the needs of ourcustomers and prospective customers with the interests of our other stakeholders,and to integrate stakeholder considerations across our value chain.

We continue to learn and make thoughtful decisions as we go, and we committo engaging with our stakeholders to understand these evolving issues.

RESPONSIBLE LENDING PRACTICES • THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP | 4



Our ESRM framework recognizesthat environmental and social issues,such as climate change and humanrights, could pose financial, legaland/or reputational risk to PNC.These responsible business issuesare critical to identify quickly andmanage proactively.



Defining Responsible Business Issues

PNC leverages well-established andrespected corporate responsibilityreporting frameworks, standards,regulations, investor expectationsand corporate responsibility materialityanalyses to focus our efforts andvoluntary disclosures on areas thatmatter most to our business and

stakeholders. However, the list ofresponsible business issues that maybe important for a company to manageis large and continually expanding.PNC considers the needs of a varietyof stakeholders, each of whom mayhold unique views as to which issuesand risks are most appropriate for usto actively manage and report against.PNC strives for a balanced approachthat addresses the priority issuessurfaced through our corporateresponsibility materiality analysis(available in our annual CorporateResponsibility Report), as well asmonitors the wide spectrum of issuesof concern to our stakeholders.



OUR APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

PNC’s Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) framework philosophy is to never takeunnecessary risks or trade long-term value for short-term gains. Our ESRM framework allows us to helpour customers realize their financial goals while diligently managing risks to our business and brand.

Given these complexities, the examples below should be considered illustrative, not comprehensive.



• Energy usage• Carbon/greenhouse gas emissions• Climate change impacts• Water usage• Waste management practices• Pollution• Renewable energy• Resource depletion• Biodiversity and nature-related impacts• Green products, technology andinfrastructure

• Corporate culture and employeeengagement• Talent management• Workforce and supplier diversity• Labor practices• Discrimination• Inclusion and belonging• Human rights• Community investment and engagement• Employee health and safety• Fair pay practices• Employee benefits

WHAT WE MONITORThe list of emerging issues ofconcern — and therefore the risksand opportunities associated withthose issues — is broad and growing.PNC considers the needs of a varietyof stakeholders, including our ownemployees, clients, investors andcommunities. From a responsiblelending perspective, we focus on:

HOW WE MONITOR

PNC does not discriminate againstany lawful industry. Material risksidentified through the ESRM RapidRisk Screen may, however, lead to thedevelopment and maintenance ofsegment-specific guidance oradditional due diligence. Occasionally,the ESRM process — which can includedirect engagement with prospectiveclients and stakeholder groups whenappropriate — may lead to a decisionto limit exposure to specificcommercial clients with elevated riskprofiles. Alternatively, we may makea concerted effort to engage indiscussions with our customers andexternal stakeholders to try to betterunderstand the potential risks anddevelop a path forward to mitigatethose risks. This is a key part of theESRM Rapid Risk Screen and ourbroader environmental and social riskmanagement approach.



Rapid Risk Screen

PNC’s Rapid Risk Screen, a part of ouroverall ESRM framework, is an internaltool that assists the commercial linesof business with identifyingtransactions that may be consideredsensitive, and could potentially besubject to additional due diligence andexecutive escalation, on a client-by-client basis.

The tool is agnostic in terms of bothindustry and transaction value,and — as its name suggests — isdesigned to provide a quick and easyway to identify and resolve significantand material environmental, social orreputational risks early in the life cycleof a transaction. The Rapid Risk Screentool inserts a pause into the transactionvetting process, allowing us to consider

whether the entity being financed, orthe purpose of the financing, may havea significant actual or perceived impacton human rights or the environment,or be in conflict with PNC’s core values.

Some examples of issues that theRapid Risk Screen is intended to helpthe business consider include:



HUMAN RIGHTS impacts on:

• Indigenous peoples (e.g., NativeAmericans)

• Landowners (e.g., through theapplication of eminent domain orforced displacement)

• Areas of historical, cultural or naturalimportance (e.g., archeological sites)

• Access to a community’s water, air,food, recreation (e.g., hunting/fishing)or land (e.g., agriculture)

• The safety of communities,businesses and workers



ENVIRONMENTAL impacts such as:

• The quality of a community’s water,air, food or land

• The health and well-being ofcommunities

• The protection of endangered orprotected species



NEGATIVE REPUTATIONAL impact dueto misalignment with:

• PNC’s brand reputation and/or publiccommitments

• PNC’s core values

Transactions needing additionalanalysis may be escalated to leaders inthe business or risk management, ourunderwriting group and/or ourResponsible Business Strategies team.Collectively, these leaders maydetermine to proceed as requested,

conduct additional due diligence andclient outreach alongside thecompany’s Responsible BusinessStrategies team, proceed on modifiedterms, or decline the transaction basedon an analysis of the client’s individualrisk profile.

The Rapid Risk Screen is industryagnostic because we recognize thatenvironmental, social and reputationalrisks can be present in any industry andwith any client. The tool is designed tobe highly modular, allowing us toquickly add additional guidance asPNC’s strategy, geographic reach orproduct set changes. It is thus capableof being updated in real time to captureemerging risks.

Although the Rapid Risk Screenprocess sits within the CorporateResponsibility Group’s ResponsibleBusiness Strategies team, ESRM isnot a function that’s wholly owned byany one team. We advocate for waysthat PNC can apply our resourcesin a manner consistent with ourcore values.



Reputational Risk Framework Policy

This policy sets forth PNC’s standardsfor managing risk associated withbusinesses that present elevated legal,regulatory and/or reputational risk,with the understanding thatreputational risk is itself a form of riskto PNC’s franchise and/or shareholdervalue. Adherence to this policyfacilitates the appropriate identification,assessment, review and monitoring ofhigh reputational risk business entities(HRRBEs) in accordance withregulatory expectations and PNC’sbrand. Certain customer/entity types orattributes may pose heightenedfinancial crime or reputational risk toPNC. Engaging in a business

relationship with such customers/entities may result in risks that areinconsistent with PNC’s businessstrategy, core values and risk appetite.PNC’s Enterprise Risk ManagementCommittee provides oversight of theReputational Risk Framework Policy,which includes defining high-riskentities, escalation and approvalexpectations, and consideration ofthe impact of any policy exceptionsto the Reputational Risk Profile ofthe organization.



Environmental Due DiligenceProcedure \& Questionnaire

This questionnaire establishesenvironmental due diligencerequirements for select commercialtransactions. For example, specifictransactions related to oil and gasunderwritten by our DiversifiedIndustries Group are subject tocompletion of an Environmental RiskQuestionnaire. The responses listed onthe questionnaire are completed foreach new borrower and updated onceeach succeeding calendar year inconjunction with a periodic review fornew and existing borrowers that exceeda set credit exposure threshold.

Some sample questions include but arenot limited to:

• Has the borrower disclosed anyenvironmental liabilities on its recentfinancial statements?

• Does the borrower have any materiallitigation or enforcement action,actual or threatened, against itrelating to environmental risk in anyof its business operations?

• Does the borrower have an in-houseperson or outside firm that isprimarily responsible for managinginternal environmental affairs andmonitoring compliance withenvironmental laws and regulations?

• Does the borrower complete regularaudits of their environmental riskmanagement procedures?

• Does the borrower own or operateoffshore oil or gas wells?



Commercial Background ResearchAutomation (COBRA) Process

This process helps reduce/mitigatelosses and minimize reputational andcompliance risk to PNC prior toentering into a new relationship with acommercial lending customer orexpanding a relationship with anexisting commercial lending customer.A COBRA report occurs when creditexposures meet a certain threshold.This includes all new money identifiedwithin the request, whether it is a newfacility or an increase to existingfacilities. COBRA reviews may also beinitiated via ad hoc requests. TheCOBRA process queries externalrecords for a number of items that may

impact the customer’s ability to obtainnew or to retain existing financialrelationships with PNC. Some of theitems reviewed in COBRA includejudgments, jury verdicts/settlements,federal/state civil suits, criminal filingsand financial services sanctions.



Risk Governance Framework

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) iscentrally responsible for the oversightof reputational risk for PNC. The ERMframework focuses on identification,assessment, monitoring and reportingof reputational risk across theorganization, including risks originatingfrom any of the ESRM Frameworkprongs listed above. PNC’s ResponsibleBusiness Strategies team, along withother first and second line of defenseteams across the organization,partners with ERM to help ensure thatPNC’s reputational risk profile isappropriate and that the rightreputational concerns are beingelevated when necessary.

The same practices leveraged acrossother risk disciplines (e.g., credit risk,operational risk) are leveraged here,including:

• Identification of reputational risks aspart of PNC’s risk identificationprogram

• Risk assessment through establishedquantification and rating practices

• Risk control and monitoring throughadherence to enterprisewide riskprogram expectations (e.g., risk andcontrol self-assessments, issuesmanagement)

• Risk appetite and key risk indicatormeasurements

• Quarterly risk reporting



GOVERNANCE

Our governance approach toEnvironmental and Social RiskManagement seeks to balance financialpriorities with environmental, humanrights, social and reputational risks toour company as we pursue our brandpurpose of helping all our stakeholdersmove forward financially.



Board Oversight

PNC’s board of directors has ultimateoversight of PNC’s strategy, includingthe risks and opportunities arising fromenvironmental, social and corporategovernance issues material to PNC’sbusiness. The full board oversees suchmatters directly, informed by eachcommittee’s oversight of the matterswithin its purview, as set forth in itscharter. For example, the Nominating\& Governance Committee generallyoversees governance matters, whileemployee-related matters aregenerally overseen by the HumanResources Committee. Given the highlyintegrated nature of environmentalconcerns, including significant climatechange issues, the full board overseesthese matters, informed by insightsfrom its committees. As an example,climate-related risks are within thepurview of the Risk Committee and arean important component of the board’soverall approach to environmentalstrategy, along with inputs from othercommittees. The board reviews thecorporate responsibility strategic planand the ESRM framework annually,receives updates on corporateresponsibility matters at least quarterlyand provides guidance to managementwith respect to such matters.



Management-Level Responsibility

At the management level, PNCmaintains executive committee (EC)-level oversight of the corporateresponsibility strategy. Our chiefcorporate responsibility officer (CCRO)leads the Corporate ResponsibilityGroup (CRG), which includesCommunity Development Banking; thePNC Foundation and CommunityAffairs; Diversity \& Inclusion; andResponsible Business Strategies.

Execution of our corporateresponsibility strategy is cross-functional and integrated into businessoperations. PNC Responsible BusinessStrategies is a consultative practicethat works with PNC’s lines of businessto apply a corporate responsibility lensto business processes, policies anddecisions. Responsible BusinessStrategies partners closely with theCorporate \& Institutional Banking(C\&IB) team, under the leadership ofthe head of C\&IB, and the EnterpriseRisk team, under the leadership of thechief risk officer, to identifytransactions that may necessitateadditional due diligence and potentialexecutive escalation.
