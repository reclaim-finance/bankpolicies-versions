L\&G’s policy on coal



3 | 03/2025



Through the implementation of this Coal Exclusion Policy, L\&G

– Asset Management Limited and its subsidiaries will exclude

from investments those companies that are involved in the

mining and extraction of thermal coal as set out in the Policy

Scope below.

Summary



We view coal’s current role in the energy mix to be incompatible with the global commitment, made under the

Paris Agreement1 (an international treaty on climate change), to limit the increase in the global average

temperature, “...to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels”, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature

increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. L\&G is committed to supporting the objectives of the Paris climate

goals.



The high quantities of greenhouse gases released due to the burning of coal implies that rapid cuts will be

needed to meet the global commitment of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 made under the Paris

Agreement. We expect coal to be a decreasing part of the energy mix, and working in the best interests of our

clients, we believe it is important to capture this transition within the portfolios that we manage2.



Context and background



There is a significant gap between the emission reductions necessary to restrict warming to the levels set out in

the Paris Agreement and the current state of emissions. To achieve this ambitious target, we must therefore

meaningfully shift our methods of generating and consuming energy globally.



The majority of greenhouse gas emissions3 caused by humans (primarily carbon dioxide and methane) come

from burning fossil fuels like thermal coal for energy. Thermal coal is used for power and heat generation. There

are substitutes available that can replace the need for coal-fired generation, including in the form of renewable

energy sources and nuclear technology. A faster-than-anticipated transition away from coal could have a

disproportionate impact on companies that rely heavily on thermal coal for their revenue.



1 An international climate change treaty, called the Paris Agreement, aims to stop the world’s average temperature rise to well-below

2oC, or ideally by 1.5 oC by the year 2100 and to limit greenhouse gas emissions from human activity to the same levels that trees, soil

and oceans can absorb naturally - known as net zero.

2 Thermal coal is used for power and heat generation. Through this policy we are evolving our approach to investment restrictions on coal,

setting the trajectory towards meeting the recommendations of the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI), which include phasing out

investments in coal by 2030 and ceasing investments in companies that generate 5% or more of revenues from coal and are investing in

new coal capacity.

Policy scope



Coal/oil sand classification and revenue threshold



We rely on data to determine whether companies derive any revenue from thermal coal and oil sands using a

third-party ESG data provider which we have selected based on the quality and coverage of their data.



This policy applies to certain companies which meet any of the following criteria:

• Involvement in thermal coal4 and/or oil sands5 by revenue (i.e. sales proceeds). This does not extend to

metallurgical coal6, which is used in steel manufacturing rather than power generation, due to the lack of

widely available alternatives.



• Companies involved in the mining and extraction of thermal coal. The scope of this policy does not extend to

metallurgical coal, which is often used in steel-making process. This is because low-carbon substitutes are

not yet economically viable.



• Screening will be carried out and exclusions will be applied to those companies that generate 20% or more

of their revenues from the mining and extraction of thermal coal.



• Screening will be carried out and exclusions will be applied to those companies that generate 20% or more

of revenues from thermal coal-fired power generation



• If a company has set out a clear plan aligned with the Paris Agreement to phase out coal by 2030 in

countries that are part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and by

2040 in non-OECD countries, we retain the option to invest; and/or



• If a company has non-coal subsidiaries7, we retain the ability to fund specific issuing entities



Screening will be carried out and exclusions will be applied to those companies that generate 20% or more of

revenues from oil sands extraction (sand and rock material that contain crude bitumen)



New investments and coal phase out



• For funds we have committed to manage in line with net-zero emissions, L\&G will exclude, in addition to the

above, companies making new investments in thermal coal and oil sands



• Across all L\&G funds, we will engage with companies with a potential for escalation with the aim of ensuring

no new thermal coal generation is developed and no further oil sand resources are exploited



• Across all L\&G funds, we will use active and escalating engagement with the aim of ensuring that phase- out

of existing unabated capacity and activity is undertaken in line with net zero pathways. This will take into



4 Thermal coal means a coal used by power plants and industrial steam boilers to produce electricity, steam or both.

5 Oil sands or tar sands, are sand and rock material that contain crude bitumen—a dense, viscous form of crude oil.

6 Metallurgical coal is generally used in industrial processes, such as steelmaking, where low-carbon substitutes are not yet economically

viable (in the absence of a carbon price). We distinguish between metallurgical and thermal coal in the exclusions we apply.

7 Non-coal subsidiaries refer to the affiliate companies of a parent company that are not involved in the coal industry and that operate in

different sectors or industries other than coal mining or coal-based energy production

consideration the need for a “just transition”8 in countries or regions where there is significant economic

dependence on thermal coal power or mining



Excluded companies



L\&G – Asset Management Limited’s coal exclusion list has been developed in conjunction with a third-party

service provider and will apply to:

• Publicly listed, private and state-owned companies



• The corporate entity only, not the company’s parent owner



L\&G – Asset Management Limited may inform companies on the exclusion list of its policy and will encourage

them to reconsider involvement in the thermal coal sector where relevant.



Excluded instruments



• L\&G – Asset Management Limited and its subsidiaries will not invest in shares or debt issued by companies

companies on its exclusion list in accordance with the section headed ‘Application to L\&G – Asset

Management Limited’s subsidiaries’ below



• This policy and the exclusion list shall be applied by L\&G – Asset Management Limited or the relevant

subsidiary (as the case may be) subject to any applicable contractual, legal and/or regulatory obligations.



Application to L\&G – Asset Management Limited’s subsidiaries

This policy applies to investments where the following LGIM(H) subsidiaries undertake investment decisions on

behalf of their respective clients:

• Legal \& General Investment Management Limited located in London



• Legal \& General Investment Management America Inc. located in Chicago



• Legal \& General Investment Management Asia Limited located in Hong Kong



Segregated mandates:



L\&G – Asset Management Limited’s subsidiaries detailed above are appointed investment managers to

segregated mandates for clients (funds that are managed as a customised account, selecting investments on

behalf of the individual investor tailored to their financial objectives).

From February 2021, L\&G encourages the adoption of this policy in segregated investment guidelines

although the client has the ultimate decision as to whether to adopt this policy.



It should be noted that:

• segregated portfolios comprising derivative and/or currency hedging overlays may have economic exposure

to indices that are not applying this policy

• this policy shall not be applied to the investment guidelines of segregated index mandates unless this policy

is included in a customised index



Pooled funds:



The L\&G – Asset Management Limited’s subsidiaries detailed above are also appointed investment managers to

pooled investment product providers affiliated with L\&G – Asset Management Limited’s. A pooled investment

being a financial product that combines investor funds together, using them to purchase a variety of investments

under one umbrella.

Subject to the sections below, this policy shall apply to pooled funds including:

1. collective investment schemes (pooled fund investments) where a subsidiary or associated company of L\&G

– Asset Management Limited is the manager



2. the unit-linked pooled insurance fund of Legal and General Assurance (Pensions Management) Limited

(also known as the Long-Term Fund)



In each case above, the policy is set out as below. More information on the pooled funds to which this policy

applies is available on request.



This policy applies to:

• all investments made on behalf of our clients (over which we have full discretion) in active equity and

fixed income funds



• all index funds which apply our Future World Protection List (FWPL) of exclusions. Where the FWPL

does not apply but an index’s methodology and rules preclude investment in coal companies, exclusions may

differ in scope to those under this policy



• all multi-asset funds (funds which aggregate a collection of different funds into one). However, where these

funds buy an index fund, there may be an economic exposure to issuers on our coal exclusion list



This policy will be applied to any directly held securities purchased through these funds.

This policy will apply to all active pooled funds as part of multi-asset strategy both on a pooled and segregated

basis.



Where a unit-linked fund wraps an externally managed fund, this policy will not apply to that externally

managed fund. However, the external manager may have their own coal exclusion policy.



We will also seek to apply this policy to all newly launched LGIM-designed products.



Implementation process



L\&G has engaged a third-party service provider to identify companies involved in thermal coal, as outlined in this

policy, and to support the development of an exclusion list. The list is reviewed twice a year and where new

companies are identified we will seek to divest holdings within the following 90 days. Where names are

removed from the list, they are then once again eligible for investment.
