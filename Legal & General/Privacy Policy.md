2024 | Net-zero – Oil \& Gas

Net-zero: Oil \& Gas

12% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions come from oil \& gas.1What does the oil \& gas sector need to do?



LGIM will vote and implement investment sanctions against companies falling short of our climate expectations.LGIM expects companies’ boards to oversee and publicly disclose answers to the following:



1. LGIM, based off McKinsey (2019), IEA (2020).2. Aiming to cover all segments of the business, as articulated within the GHG protocol guidance. These targets should include both absolute and intensity targets, and forIntegrated oil \& gas companies, we expect separate medium- and long-term emission targets for their upstream business.3. Short-term refers to 2022-2025, medium-term 2026-2035 and long-term 2036-2050.4. E.g., Managed decline of oil and gas production; restrict oil sands; responsible divestments; investments in CCUS, hydrogen, renewables, EV charging, biofuels etc.5. E.g., The Oil \& Gas Methane Partnership 2.0.



Net-zero commitment

• Does the company have a comprehensive target for net-zero by 2050 or earlier, covering scopes 1, 2 andmaterial scope 3 emissions? 2

• Has the company made a commitment to certify/certified this target with the SBTi or other external

independent parties?

• Does the company have a net-zero transition plan that includes short- and medium-term targets? 3



Strategy

• What are the actions and investments embedded in the company’s plan to reach net-zero, and what is thecontribution of each action towards meeting its targets?4

• Does the company place restrictions on investing in the exploration of new greenfield sites?

• Is executive remuneration aligned with the company’s short- and/or medium-term emission targets, as setout in the net-zero transition plan?

• Does the company’s decarbonisation strategy address and incorporate the impact of the Just Transition?

• Does the company’s net-zero strategy integrate an assessment of related-nature risk and opportunities,impacts, and dependencies – for example, in relation to land-use change/biofuel production/offsetting?

Resilience

• Has the company analysed its business model resilience to climate-related risks and opportunities usingscenario analysis (including the IEA’s net-zero by 2050 scenario and a 'business as usual' scenario) and

disclosed how the output has influenced its strategy?

• Has the company disclosed the undiscounted costs to decommission its assets, including assumptionsand sensitivities to the most relevant climate scenarios?

• Has the company analysed the physical climate risks to its assets and operations, including potential

financial impacts, and evidenced measures to mitigate or adapt to them?

Targets

• Does the company have a target for material scope 3 emissions?

• Does the company have a target to grow the production of/revenue from low carbon products?



Collaboration

• How is the company working collaboratively across its value chain to reduce emissions (e.g. customers,

finance sector, strategic R\&D partnerships, sector initiatives etc)?5

• Is the company advocating meaningful policy action, including from regulators, to meet global net-zerotargets (e.g. with carbon pricing)?



Red lines

• Has the company committed to net-zero operational emissions?

• Does the company have time-bound methane reduction/zero flaring targets?

• Does the company disclose its climate-related lobbying/advocacy activities, including trade associationmemberships, and explain the action it will take if these are not aligned with a 1.5°C scenario?

Nature expectations

Why? The climate and nature crises are inextricably linked.6 Climate

change is one of the five direct drivers of nature change. Net-zero

requires both emission avoidance and sequestration. Therefore, theinter-dependencies between climate and nature are a critical factorin the transition.



LGIM’s expectations: As part of a climate transition plan,companies should integrate an assessment of the related naturerisks and opportunities, impacts and dependencies, andappropriate mitigation actions.7



Sector-specific considerations: Direct impacts could result fromexploration and development: oil spills, ocean noise, alien species,

water extraction etc. Indirectly – through financing of poor

offsetting practices and the production of biofuels.

Company levers Government policies



• Managed decline for upstream business

• Shift to lower-carbon product mix

• Electrification and renewables in pursuit of net-zero

operational emissions

• Methane reductions possible at no net cost

• Blending hydrogen / biomethane in gas grid

• Installing EV charging in petrol stations



• Stable and higher carbon prices

• Removal of subsidies

• Strengthened flaring and venting regulation

• Zero-emissions transport/heat/power standards

• Waste collection and recycling standards

• Development of low-carbon infrastructure

• Standards for biofuels and hydrogen
