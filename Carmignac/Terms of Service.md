CARMIGNAC’S EXCLUSION POLICY

OCTOBER 2025

2



Carmignac is fully committed to actively managing investments on behalf of investors. We stand

out due to our thorough proprietary analysis and company engagements. It is part of Carmignac’s

fiduciary duty to assess environmental, social and governance factors in the investment process

and offer suitable investment solutions. With this in mind, we believe our investments should be

made in companies with sustainable business models. As such, we have compiled an exclusion

list with companies that do not meet Carmignac’s investment standards due to their business

activities or breaches of international norms.



SCOPE – The “Business norms” and “Business activity” exclusions with the “firm-wide exclusion” mention

below apply to all funds that are open-ended funds where Carmignac acts as investment manager. For

fund specific exclusions please refer to the “Funds specific in scope per exclusion category” section at the

end of this document.

We will not knowingly hold any securities that we identify to be in violation of the above guidelines. We

do not exclude companies whose products or business activities’ main purpose is not stated in the above

guidelines.



Our Socially Responsible Investment Funds have broadened their commitments through additional

negative screening and exclusions, detailed in the following sections, in the Transparency Code and fund

documentation published on our website.



1. BUSINESS NORMS EXCLUSIONS



Carmignac adheres to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the United Nations

Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP), the International Labour Organization (ILO)

Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the Organisation for Economic Co-

operation and Development (OECD) guidelines for multinational enterprises. These frameworks help us

evaluate companies' adherence to various norms, such as human rights, labor laws, and climate

practices. To assist us in monitoring and identifying controversies, we rely on an external data provider,

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). ISS categorizes controversies as red, amber, or green based on

their severity. Our sustainable investment team carefully analyses these controversies, paying particular

attention to the red ones. Through our proprietary analysis, we determine whether the controversy

should be lifted or if it warrants the exclusion of the issuer. Controversies may be lifted after internal

analysis in the following cases:

- The controversy takes a side in a geopolitical conflict.

- The issuer is involved in a controversy but has limited operational control over resolving the issue.

- The issuer has already taken credible and measurable steps to address a legacy controversy and

we are expecting this to be reflected in the severity rating of the controversy.



For companies that severely breach these principles and guidelines, but are invested in following the

internal review, we may implement an enhanced engagement process. If this process, which can take

up to three years, fails to bring about the desired change, we will exclude the company from our

investment universe.

2. BUSINESS ACTIVITY EXCLUSIONS



TOBACCO



Firm wide Exclusion



Carmignac considers investment in tobacco companies to be unsustainable, given

that it is an unhealthy and polluting product with no safe level of consumption.

Tobacco kills more than 8 million people worldwide each year1, including an

estimated 1.3 million non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke1. In

addition to the detrimental impact of tobacco on health, the total economic cost

of smoking (from health expenditures and productivity losses combined) is

estimated to be around US$ 1.4 trillion per year2. The acetate cellulose present in

cigarette filters takes up to 14 years to decompose in the nature and can pollute

up to 500L of water3. In addition, the nicotine present in tobacco products is highly

addictive, making it difficult for users to stop smoking despite knowing the

harmful effects of the habit on their health.

We exclude companies that are involved in the production of tobacco including

alternative tobacco smoking products such as e-cigarettes. We also exclude those

which have significant ownership4 in such companies, as well as those which are

involved in the wholesale distribution of tobacco or in the supply of cigarette

components, such as filters (≥5% of firm revenue).



THERMAL COAL



Carmignac acknowledges that reducing thermal coal emissions, as recommended

by scientists5, is one of the most effective ways of transitioning to a cleaner energy

system and being consistent with the Paris Agreement6. In 2022, emissions related

to the burning of thermal coal accounts for around 10% of global emissions7

through highly potent methane emissions. These emissions have a global

warming potential around 30 times higher than regular carbon dioxide over 100

years8. Furthermore, Carmignac pledges that, should there be any future coal-

related investments permitted within the confines of Carmignac’s Exclusion

\*The exclusion list built for label compliance are constructed using more restrictive criteria (ie companies with any ties to the activities mentioned

above). Some issuers can be reintegrated to the investable universe using the below criteria for each exclusion category after an ad hoc analysis

conducted by the Sustainable Investment team.

Policy, a total exit from coal-related investee companies will be implemented by

2030 for OECD countries and 2040 for non-OECD countries. We deem that

thermal coal faces an increasing investment risk for the future, as companies are

moving away from thermal coal as a fuel source



Firm wide exclusion



To avoid the risk of owning stranded thermal coal mines through our investments,

we have developed a framework to exclude any company which derives more

than 10% of their revenue from thermal coal mining or produces \>20 million tons

of thermal coal per year. Carmignac will not knowingly directly finance new

coal mining projects. Should an investee company through acquisition be

involved in new coal projects, Carmignac will seek to disinvest within a defined /

precise timeframe.



Extended Thermal Coal - Fund specific exclusion



In addition to our firm wide exclusion, some of our funds have a stricter exclusion

criteria on thermal coal. Companies which derive any revenue from activities in

exploration, mining, extraction, transportation, distribution or refining of thermal

coal or providing dedicated equipment or services for such companies are

excluded from the investment universe.

The company must not be involved in the exploitation or development of

new coal mines.

In addition, a company involved in the aforementioned activities could be

reintegrated to the investment universe if it meets the following criteria:



• Have an annual thermal coal production less than 10Mt and derive less than

5% of its revenues from activities described above.



OIL AND GAS



The oil and gas sector remains a foundationally important area of the economy as

it delivers energy security and helps maintain modern living standards in

developed markets and improves living conditions in emerging markets, as we

necessarily transition to a cleaner energy system. Indeed, the International Energy

Agency (IEA) predicts demand for oil will peak before 20309 after which it is

expected to plateau for some time before declining. Due to the relatively early

stage of the energy transition we are in, Carmignac does not believe that the sector

should face a blanket exclusion from our investment universe at firm level until

the new clean energy system is more widely implemented. Instead, we utilise a



9 International Energy Agency: https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2024#overview

5



range of approaches including portfolio net zero targets, a case by case approach

to assessing the ESG risks and transition plan based on individual companies

performance, with stewardship consequences if required and clear reporting.



Carmignac however does have a fund range with higher ESG outcome standards

for which oil and gas companies are excluded according to the criteria described

below.



Oil and Gas Extraction – Fund specific exclusion



For some of our funds, companies that derive more than 5% of their revenues

from the exploration and extraction of O\&G are excluded from the fund’s

investment universe.



Conventional and Unconventional Oil And Gas – Fund specific Exclusion



Some of our funds have stricter oil and gas exclusions than the one described

above. The company shall currently not be involved in exploration, and not be

involved in exploitation or development of new oil or gas fields.

In addition companies which derive any revenue from activities in exploration,

extraction, refining, and transportation of conventional and unconventional O\&G

(defined as tar/oil sands, shale oil, shale gas and Arctic drilling) or providing

dedicated equipment or services for such companies are excluded from the

investment universe.

On an exceptional basis, a company with any involvement in the aforementioned

activities can be deemed investable if it meets at least one of the following criteria

following a dedicated analysis from the Sustainable Investment team:

• Less than 5% revenues from O\&G activities as described above

• Have more than 15% CAPEX dedicated to contributing activities, such as EU

Taxonomy aligned activities not including natural gas or nuclear power or SDG

aligned activities10 (if a company is involved in unconventional O\&G the CAPEX

requirement increases to 50%).

• Companies deriving less than 25% of its revenues from bespoke products,

equipment or services dedicated to enabling the execution of activities described

above



POWER GENERATIONS



Power generators play a crucial role in the global energy transition. Emissions

related to the power generation industry contribute to 26% of global emissions11,



10 https://www.carmignac.fr/en_GB/sustainable-investment/approach

11 UNEP: Emissions Gap report 2024: https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2024

contributing largely to global warming and requiring a framework to ensure our

investments do not contribute further to these. Even though thermal coal may

have a short-term role in the economic development and growth of emerging

countries, in a context of falling renewable energy prices, coal-powered plants will

not be viable over the long-term.

A dual criteria looking at the mix of high polluting power assets such as coal and

natural gas as well as the power generation carbon intensity using gCo2/kWh

allows for a credible approach to high polluting power generators.



Firm wide Exclusion



Knowing that a typical coal power plant will generate electricity at an intensity of

800 to 1200 gCo2/kWh and a natural gas power plant will generate an intensity of

400 to 600 gCo2/kWh, Carmignac has committed to exclude companies

generating electricity above the below thresholds informed by the International

Energy Agency (IEA) to keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees, as set out

by the Paris Agreement.



2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028



Max. gCO2/kWh 366 326 291 260 232 207



In addition, power generation companies with more than 10% of their

generation mix in thermal coal are excluded.



Carmignac recognizes the importance of encouraging companies to reduce their

dependence on coal power generation in order to align their activities with the

Paris Agreement. Hence, Carmignac will consider making exceptions to its

exclusion rules for the power generators making credible commitments (ie SBTI

approved targets or well defined transition strategies with clear coal exit policies)

to reduce and exit their thermal coal-based power generation.



Extended Power Generation - Funds exclusion



Carmignac has a fund range with higher ESG outcome standards which have

stricter exclusions on power generators than the one described above. Companies

shall currently not be involved in building new coal-fired power stations and its

absolute production of or capacity for coal-based power shall not be structurally

increasing and be less than 5 GW. In addition, companies with activities in the

generation of power/heat from non-renewable energy sources or providing

dedicated equipment or services for such companies are excluded from the

investment universe.

7



On an exceptional basis, a company with any involvement in the aforementioned

activities can be deemed investable if it meets at least one of the following criteria

following a dedicated analysis from the Sustainable Investment team:

• Have a carbon intensity lower than 291 gCO2/kWh

• Have a SBTi target set at well-below 2°C or 1.5°C, or have a SBTi ‘Business

Ambition for 1.5°C’ commitment

• Derive less than 5% of its revenues from activities described above

• Derive more than 50% of its revenues from contributing activities such as EU

Taxonomy aligned activities not including natural gas or nuclear power or SDG

aligned activities12

• Have more than 50% of capital expenditure dedicated to contributing activities

such as EU Taxonomy aligned activities not including natural gas or nuclear power

or SDG aligned activities14



Nuclear energy production - Fund Specific Exclusion



Some of our funds have stricter criteria nuclear exclusions reflecting the

uncertainty and risks around long-term storage of high-level nuclear waste.

Companies that derive more than 5% of revenues from production of nuclear

energy are excluded from the investment universe.



ADULT ENTERTAINMENT AND PORNOGRAPHY



Firm Wide exclusion



The adult entertainment and pornography industry has high risks associated with

human trafficking as well as the exploitation of underaged women. Additionally,

the industry has a negative impact on society by promoting and normalizing the

improper objectification and violence towards women.13

We exclude companies who receive \>2% of their revenues from the production or

distribution of Adult Entertainment and Pornography, or those which have a

significant ownership14 in such companies.



WEAPONS



Controversial weapons are excluded at firm level because they cause

indiscriminate harm and long lasting damages to civilians and the environment

and are widely considered unethical and inhumane. In contrast, conventional

weapons, provided they are used in accordance with international law, are a

fundamental component of international defence and an indispensable tool for

maintaining national security and stability which is why they are only excluded in

our fund range with higher ESG standards.



Controversial Weapons - Firm Wide Exclusion

Carmignac deems anti-personnel mines, nuclear weapons, cluster munitions,

biological and chemical weapons, depleted uranium, white phosphorus

munitions, blinding lasers, white phosphorous and non-detectable fragments to

be controversial weapons. We exclude companies which manufacture products

that do not comply with the following treaties or legal bans on controversial

weapons:



1. The Ottawa Treaty (1997), which prohibits the use, stockpiling, production

and transfer of anti-personnel mines.

2. The Convention on Cluster Munitions (2008), which prohibits the use,

stockpiling, production and transfer of cluster munitions.

3. The Chemical Weapons Convention (1997), which prohibits the use,

stockpiling, production and transfer of chemical weapons.

4. The Biological Weapons Convention (1975), which prohibits the use,

stockpiling, production and transfer of biological weapons.

5. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968), which limits

the spread of nuclear weapons to the group of so-called nuclear weapons

states (USA, Russia, UK, France and China).

6. The Belgian Loi Mahoux, which bans uranium weapon investments.

7. The 1980 Convention on certain conventional weapons concerning non

detectable fragments, mines incendiary weapons, blinding laser weapons.



Conventional Weapons Producers - Fund Specific Exclusion



For some of our funds, companies that derive more than 10% of revenues from

the manufacture of conventional weapons including firearms and components.



Conventional Weapons - Fund Specific Exclusion



Some of our funds have even stricter exclusion criteria on conventional weapons.

Companies that derive more than 5% of revenues from the manufacture and sale

of conventional weapons including firearms and support services and equipment

are excluded from the investment universe.

9



ALCOHOL



Fund Specific Exclusion



Alcohol consumption is linked to a range of health issues, including addiction,

liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and mental health disorders. The negative

health impacts can place a significant burden on healthcare systems and society.

In addition to its health impact, alcohol abuse can also lead to various social

problems, such as domestic violence, crime, accidents, and reduced productivity.

These issues can have far-reaching effects on communities and economies.

This is why Carmignac has a fund range with higher ESG outcome standards for

which companies that derive more than 10% of revenues from the production of

alcohol are excluded from the investment universe (our Carmignac Emerging

Markets Equities range uses a 5% revenues threshold).



GAMBLING



Fund Specific Exclusion



Gambling is considered to be highly addictive and causes severe social, financial

and psychological harm. Estimates suggest that 1.2% of the world’s adult

population is suffering from a gambling addiction15. This is why Carmignac has a

fund range with higher ESG outcome standards for which companies that derive

more than 2% of revenues from gambling-related business activities are excluded

from the investment universe.



ANIMAL WELFARE



Fund Specific Exclusion



Agriculture contributes to 11% of global emissions primarily due to emissions

from livestock16. In addition, commercial animal husbandry and animal testing

has strong ties to animal cruelty.

This is why Carmignac has a fund range with higher ESG standards for which

companies that are involved in commercial animal husbandry for the purpose

of food production, including breeding, raising, and slaughtering pork, veal,

poultry, and beef, as well as dairy and egg farm operators are excluded from the

investment universe. This category does not include restaurants or other food

establishments where meat products are sold. Companies that are on the

10



People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) list of facilities that

manufacture animal-tested products, as well as brands that are owned by

companies that have not yet adopted a permanent "no animal testing" policy are

also excluded from the investment universe.



PALM OIL



Fund Specific Exclusion

Production of palm oil is a leading cause of deforestation, particularly in tropical

regions like Indonesia and Malaysia. This deforestation leads to the destruction

of habitats for endangered species contributing to biodiversity loss. In addition

to the disastrous impact of palm oil on biodiversity, there are numerous reports

of human rights abuses in the palm oil industry, including poor working

conditions, child labor, and exploitation of workers. Indigenous communities are

often displaced from their land to make way for palm oil plantations, leading to

social conflicts and loss of livelihoods. This is why Carmignac has a fund range

with higher ESG outcome standards for which companies that are involved in

the palm oil industry, including producer, distributor, and owners are excluded

from the fund’s investment universe.



AIRLINES



Fund Specific Exclusion



The airline industry is a significant contributor to global carbon emissions (2 to

3% of global emissions) due to the burning of fossil fuels. Some arguments exists

for the substitution of short regional flights with less polluting alternative

transports. This is why Carmignac has a fund range with higher ESG standards

for which airlines are excluded from the investment universe.



SOVEREIGN EXPOSURE POLICY- Fund Specific Exclusion–



States that issue sovereign instruments are classified based on the income level of their economy,

based on the classifications of the World Bank: low-income, lower middle-income, upper middle-

income and high-income economies.



All our sovereign instruments in Belgian label portfolios comply with the 6 Worldwide Governance

Indicators (WGI), established by the World Bank:

1\. Voice and Accountability

2\. Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism

11



3\. Government Effectiveness

4\. Regulatory Quality

5\. Rule of Law

6\. Control of Corruption



A State is eligible if both of the following conditions are met; it is otherwise excluded

• The average of its scores on all 6 WGIs is at least -0.59

• It does not score less than -1.00 on a single WGI



Additional criteria for high-income economies:



In addition to the base criteria stated above, high-income economy States must also meet the

following requirements:



The State has ratified or has implemented in equivalent national legislation:

o the eight fundamental conventions identified in the International Labour Organisation’s

declaration on Fundamental Rights and Principles at Work

o at least half of the 18 core International Human Rights Treaties. The State is party to:

• the Paris Agreement

• the UN Convention on Biological Diversity

• the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty

• The State does not have a particularly high military budgets (\>4% GDP)

• The State is not considered a ‘Jurisdiction with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies’ by the

FATF

• The State scores at least 40/100 on the Transparency International Corruption

Perception Index

• The State is not qualified as ‘Not free’ by the Freedom House 'Freedom in the World’-

survey

• The State does not have the death penalty legal and in use



All States not meeting the criteria above will be excluded; unless exception described below:



Exceptions:



Portfolios can invest for reasons of diversification or (currency risk) hedging, in public debt

instruments issued by core reserve (non-EURO) currency issuers that do not comply with the

above requirements, to a maximum of 30% (in total) of the portfolio. This threshold may

temporarily be exceeded in the event of extraordinary market circumstances to protect investors’

financial interests. Use-of-proceeds instruments issued by non-compliant States can still be

eligible.



• Use-of-proceeds Instruments

12



Use-of-proceeds instruments issued by sovereigns that fail the aforementioned criteria can be

eligible if it meets the following criteria:



o Use-of-proceeds instruments comply with an appropriate framework (e.g., ICMA/CBI/EU

GBS/LMA) and be subject to independent external review. For some specific issuers,

supranational institutions and agencies, this might not be possible. In that case, elaborate

on equivalence (see c.).

o Issuers and beneficiaries of use-of-proceeds instruments are subject to the ESG due

diligence process of the manager. The environmental, social and governance aspects of

the financed programs/projects shall be taken into account when investing in use-of-

proceeds instruments.

o The evaluation of use-of-proceeds instruments issued by financial institutions, sovereigns

and supra-nationals is left to the discretion of the manager.



UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO – FUND SPECIFIC EXCLUSION



For some of our funds with higher ESG constraints, at least 90% of underlying portfolios (measured by

AUM) are:

a) Underlying portfolios that have the Towards Sustainability label.

b) Underlying index-based portfolios evaluated on QS compliance using a look-through

approach, if based on a solid regular monitoring and audit system. The look-through

approach shall ensure that the composition of the indices is compliant with the

exclusionary requirements of the QS.

c) To a maximum of 30% of underlying portfolios, (unlabelled) sovereign bonds

portfolios that only invest in sovereign-issued instruments issued by States compliant

with the criteria for high-income economies.



The remainder (max. 10% measured by AUM) of underlying portfolios are portfolios that promote ESG

characteristics, comply with the Belgian label criteria on sustainable investments and consider principal

adverse impacts on sustainability factors.



Underlying money market funds are considered cash-equivalent and are not evaluated if their only

purpose is technical or for the hedging of risks.

13



3. IMPLEMENTATION



A. GUIDELINES



1. For company exclusions, all listed company-related investment instruments (e.g. equity, single

issuer name derivatives and corporate bonds) are in scope.

2. Carmignac’s in-house ESG team, supported by external data, tools and research providers,

undertakes a series of ESG-themed assessments which identify companies within our investment

universe that could qualify for potential exclusion.

3. Any new firm-wide sector exclusion is discussed within the Investment team, which is then

submitted to Carmignac’s Strategic Development Committee for approval.

4. Cases of companies with controversial behaviour are discussed firstly within the Investment and

Sustainable Investment team. The decision must be backed up with specific arguments and is

concluded on by the SI team.

5. For discretionary mandates and client-specific investments solutions, Carmignac will initially

suggest clients apply the current Carmignac exclusion framework; but Carmignac may finally

apply further / different restrictions if requested by client.

6. If company A is partially owned by company B and company B is involved in controversial

behaviour, controversial weapons, thermal coal mining or tobacco, Carmignac will not exclude

company A.

7. The list of excluded companies does not apply to index derivatives, whose administrators are

external parties.

8. Excluded companies will be reviewed on a quarterly basis, using Carmignac’s proprietary

assessment framework, to check if relevant changes have been made to the company’s activities

or behaviour. A review of such changes may lead to the exclusion being lifted.

9. Once an invested company is placed on Carmignac’s exclusion list, we will divest any holdings

from our Funds within a defined and precise timeframe. Carmignac’s Compliance team monitors

adherence. Any identified breach to the defined timeframe would be dully escalated to the

Strategic Development Committee.



B. GOVERNANCE AND MONITORING OF THE POLICY



Carmignac's Strategic Product Committee, composed of Carmignac Senior Managers, oversees the

adequate implementation and update of the exclusion policy at the firm level. Acting as an escalation

body, this governance group decides on the additions and/or deletions and to approve exceptions of the

exclusion list should that be necessary.



An operational framework is also in place to manage our exclusion list. Exclusions are monitored by the

Investment Management and the Sustainable Investment team as a first level of control through the

portfolio management trading system where hard exclusions of sectors and processes mentioned in this

exclusion policy are registered and cannot be traded. The Compliance team acts as a second level of

control and ensures that the applied exclusion strategy complies with the various constraints (regulatory,

statutory and internal), using the software Bloomberg Compliance Manager tool (CMGR).

5. OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES



Enterprises should take fully into account established policies in the countries in which they operate

and consider the views of other stakeholders. In this regard, enterprises should:



1. Contribute to economic, environmental and social progress with a view to achieving sustainable

development.

2. Respect the internationally recognised human rights of those affected by their activities.

3. Encourage local capacity building through close co-operation with the local community, including

business interests, as well as developing the enterprise’s activities in domestic and foreign

markets, consistent with the need for sound commercial practice.

4. Encourage human capital formation, in particular by creating employment opportunities and

facilitating training opportunities for employees.

5. Refrain from seeking or accepting exemptions not contemplated in the statutory or regulatory

framework related to human rights, environmental, health, safety, labour, taxation, financial

incentives, or other issues.

15



6. Support and uphold good corporate governance principles and develop and apply good

corporate governance practices, including throughout enterprise groups.

7. Develop and apply effective self-regulatory practices and management systems that foster a

relationship of confidence and mutual trust between enterprises and the societies in which they

operate.

8. Promote awareness of and compliance by workers employed by multinational enterprises with

respect to company policies through appropriate dissemination of these policies, including

through training programmes.

9. Refrain from discriminatory or disciplinary action against workers who make bona fide reports

to management or, as appropriate, to the competent public authorities, on practices that

contravene the law, the Guidelines or the enterprise’s policies.

10. Carry out risk-based due diligence, for example by incorporating it into their enterprise risk

management systems, to identify, prevent and mitigate actual and potential adverse impacts as

described in paragraphs 11 and 12, and account for how these impacts are addressed. The nature

and extent of due diligence depend on the circumstances of a particular situation.

11. Avoid causing or contributing to adverse impacts on matters covered by the Guidelines, through

their own activities, and address such impacts when they occur.

12. Seek to prevent or mitigate an adverse impact where they have not contributed to that impact,

when the impact is nevertheless directly linked to their operations, products or services by a

business relationship. This is not intended to shift responsibility from the entity causing an

adverse impact to the enterprise with which it has a business relationship.

13. In addition to addressing adverse impacts in relation to matters covered by the Guidelines,

encourage, where practicable, business partners, including suppliers and sub-contractors, to

apply principles of responsible business conduct compatible with the Guidelines.

14. Engage with relevant stakeholders in order to provide meaningful opportunities for their views

to be taken into account in relation to planning and decision making for projects or other

activities that may significantly impact local communities.

15. Abstain from any improper involvement in local political activities
