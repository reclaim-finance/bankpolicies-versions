RBC Policy Guidelines for Sensitive Sectors and Activities2



Our environmental and social risk management (ESRM) processis designed to ensure we apply a suitable level of due diligence ona transaction. We maintain a suite of ESRM policies designed toidentify, assess and mitigate the environmental and social risksassociated with financing our clients. We believe these policies arein keeping with our leadership role in environmental and social riskmanagement, and are reflective of our commitment to a balanced,responsible approach to business. We proactively review and updateour ESRM policies and procedures to address regulatory changes,emerging and evolving issues, and international best practices.

Certain sensitive sectors and activities require focused policyguidelines that are described below:

Coal

While coal-fired power continues to be a significant sourceof electricity generation in many jurisdictions, particularly indeveloping economies, it is also one of the largest global sourcesof greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants that impact airquality. Coal mining can result in a number of adverse effects on theenvironment depending on the methods of extraction that need tobe considered in the due diligence process. As a result, we identifycoal-fired power and coal mining as high risk and place restrictionson transactions in this sector. Specifically:



• RBC will not finance transactions where the proceeds will be

primarily used to develop a new greenfield coal-fired power plant,thermal coal mine or Mountain Top Removal coal mining projects.

• RBC will not provide financing to new clients that operate

significant thermal coal mining (\>60% revenue) or coal powergeneration assets (\>60% generation, Megawatt hour (MwH).

• RBC will provide financing to new clients that operate some thermal

coal mining (≤ 60% revenue) and coal power generation assets(≤60% generation, MwH) if the client can provide clear evidencethat they are:o Reducing their use of coal (e.g. diversifying, retiring assets);and/oro Reducing their GHG emissions; and/or

o Converting to high-efficiency, low emissions (HELE) or othertechnologies that lower GHG emissions.

• For existing clients that operate thermal coal mining or coal powergeneration assets, RBC will support the client in their transition to

lower carbon emissions.

• RBC will track and monitor our credit exposure to coal mining

and coal power generation and endeavor to reduce it over time insupport of the transition to a low carbon economy.

The Arctic

RBC recognizes the natural and cultural significance of the Arctic

ecosystem that is threatened by a number of factors, includingclimate change. The harsh conditions and fragile ecosystems makeit a particularly vulnerable and challenging region for energy andresource development projects. We identify resource and energydevelopment activities in the Arctic as high risk. Transactionsthat directly support exploration or development in the Arcticrequire enhanced due diligence and must be approved by a senioroversight committee.

The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)

The ANWR in northeastern Alaska is the largest national wildliferefuge in the United States and home to some of the most diverseand abundant wildlife in the Arctic. Due to its particular ecological

and social significance and vulnerability, RBC will not provide direct

financing for any project or transaction that involves exploration ordevelopment in the ANWR.

UNESCO World Heritage Sites

World Heritage Sites are landmarks or areas having cultural,historical, scientific or other forms of significance and have legalprotection through an international convention administered by the

United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO). Due to their cultural and natural significance, RBC

will not provide direct financing for any project or transactionthat involves exploration or development in UNESCO WorldHeritage Sites.
