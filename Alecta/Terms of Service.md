1 Background, scope and purpose

This policy is a supplement to Alecta's Investment Guidelines [Investeringsriktlinjer]

and describes how Alecta works with responsible investments with a focus on corporate

governance and ESG1. This policy document applies to Alecta and is decided by Alecta's

Board. Corresponding policy documents must also be adopted in Alecta's subsidiaries

which operate activities where it is considered appropriate to do so.



1.1 Alecta's mission

Alecta Tjänstepension Ömsesidigt (Alecta) is the largest occupational pension company

in the Nordic region, with 35,000 corporate clients and 2.6 million private insured

individuals. Our mission is to maximise the value of occupational pensions for our

corporate and private customers.

Alecta has been entrusted with managing a significant capital in a reliable, competitive,

efficient, and sustainable manner. The objective of the asset management is to ensure

Alecta's commitments towards the insured individuals and to strive for the highest

possible long-term return on assets under management.

As owner and investor, Alecta must behave in a judicious way that earns respect and

trust both from Alecta's customers, the companies we invest in and actors we

collaborate with.



1.2 Sustainability approach

Alecta's sustainability work2 and responsible investments builds on our mission.

Through our focus on active in-house asset management, we apply the sustainability

dimension both as a risk perspective and to seek investment opportunities that

promote sustainable development with good returns. This is aligned with Alecta's target

for value creation and return on managed capital.



1 ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance which is a concept for sustainability that is used

in financial activities.

Alecta’s investment strategy is based on the long-term perspective that management of

occupational pension capital entails. A longer time horizon also makes it natural to

have a broader perspective on risks and opportunities in the investment analysis,

including sustainability aspects that often have an effect over longer periods of time.

The balance between financial, environmental, and social values is an important

prerequisite for long-term value creation and return for Alecta's customers. Alecta’s

investment strategy considers ESG aspects, through careful analysis of selected

investment objects.

Alecta's approach to sustainability applies both to direct investments and to externally

managed assets although the ESG processes may differ. For new investments in funds

or indirectly owned assets, the policy must be applied as far as possible.



2 Guiding frameworks and positions

Alecta is a signatory of the Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI) and has

undertaken to integrate ESG into the management of the investment portfolio and to

work to promote the work with ESG. At the core of Alecta's responsible investment

efforts, there are international conventions for the environment, human rights,

employment law, corruption and controversial weapons signed by Sweden, expressed

in agreements such as the UN Global Compact, UN Guiding Principles on Business and

Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Companies.

Alecta also supports the TCFD3 framework and applies it using the GHG4protocol for

climate reporting.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals in the 2030 Agenda are a broad framework for

global sustainability and a point of reference for investments that, in addition to

financial returns, have an explicit objective of contributing to social or environmental

benefits.



2.1 Climate goals and characteristics promoted

Alecta has an overall climate goal in line with the Paris Agreement and is a member of

the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) with a long-term ambition for the entire

investment portfolio to have a net zero footprint by 2050. Within the framework of this

initiative, Alecta adopts interim targets in five-year intervals.

In accordance with the SFDR regulation, Alecta’s occupational pension products

promote a number of characteristics, meaning that in our investments we put a special

emphasis on climate, gender equality and sound remuneration in accordance with what

is set out in this policy. 5



2.2 Statements and exclusions

In general, Alecta's investment strategy is based on making investments in a limited

number of carefully selected assets that are considered to contribute to the overall

objective of a good long-term return. As an essential part of the choice of these assets,

ESG factors are considered, both from a risk perspective and to promote sustainable

development with good returns. Alecta is a committed owner who wants to support the

companies to develop in a sustainable direction. That is described in more detail in

section 3. In this section, we give Alecta's view on a number of areas that many

stakeholders take interest in.



2.2.1 View on green and sustainable investments

Alecta has a broad portfolio and considers ESG-factors in each investment decision.

When possible, we also want to invest in assets that promote sustainable development

and that meet the requirements for risk-adjusted returns and contribute to fulfilling the

mission of creating value for Alecta's customers. Examples of such assets are green

bonds and so-called impact investments that meet a number of criteria and principles

that Alecta has set up.



2.2.2 Position statements

Alecta's expectations on portfolio companies or other types of assets, are formulated in

the position statements on alecta.se6, which are updated on an ongoing basis. The

position statements express Alecta’s view on good practice, the desired development

that Alecta wants to promote, or exclusions. Examples of position statements include

human rights, business ethics or biodiversity.



2.2.3 Exclusions

Alecta does not invest in companies that violate the international conventions that

Sweden is a signatory to. These are conventions with principles on environment,

human rights, labour, anti-corruption and controversial weapons which also are

expressed in initiatives as the UN Global Compact, UN Guiding Principles on Business

and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Companies. Before

each new investment, a review based on these conventions is carried out by an external

party.

Alecta does not invest in companies whose business, directly or indirectly, includes

controversial weapons. These are weapons that, because of their effect, cannot be

definitions of the regulation Alecta’s pension products are so called Article 8 products. The full

used under international law, either because they affect civilians and soldiers

indiscriminately or because they cause unnecessary suffering. These include anti-

personal landmines, biological weapons, chemical weapons, cluster munitions,

incendiary bombs, laser-blinding weapons and weapons containing non-detectable

fragments. Further, Alecta does not invest in companies that directly violate The Treaty

on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons or in companies that develop, upgrades

or manufactures nuclear weapons or key components and services for nuclear weapons.

We see the climate issue as a defining sustainability issue, and carbon is the fossil fuel

that has the greatest negative impact on the climate. Alecta refrains from investing in or

financing companies with more than 5% of their turnover from the extraction of

thermal coal and companies with more than 5% of their turnover from energy

production based on thermal coal. Alecta also refrains from investing in or financing

companies with more than 5% of their turnover from the extraction of

unconventional oil and gas7.

Alecta does not invest in companies whose core business involves gambling

activities8 or the production of tobacco.

Investments are not made in companies domiciled in jurisdictions that are included in

the EU's list of non-cooperative jurisdictions9 with reference to tax and

transparency. We also expect that the companies we invest in will not exploit these

jurisdictions for tax planning purposes.

We do not engage in direct financing of countries that violate human rights and

democracy, have widespread corruption or are on the UN, US and EU sanction lists, or

that fail to adopt a climate target.



3 ESG in investment process, management and

corporate governance



3.1 Analysis and selection

Alecta manages assets in-house by managing the majority of the investment assets

internally. In exceptional cases, where it is assessed to be more effective, external

managers can be used. The investment strategy is focused on a few selected investment

areas, where Alecta wants to make investments that benefit from economies of scale,

have high cost-efficiency. We avoid complex set-ups.

The selection is a fundamental part of investing responsibly. Alecta seeks investments

that contribute to long-term value creation, which requires careful analysis of each

investment and of each partner. In the analysis and investment decision, ESG,

international conventions and exclusion criteria as described in section 2.2 Positions

and exclusions are taken into account.



3.2 Dialogue and engagement

Alecta's corporate governance aims to increase the value of our investments by being an

engaged and professional owner. Dialogues can be conducted proactively to support

companies we invest in by highlighting ESG aspects that we consider important or

where we seek more transparency to strengthen our own analysis of risks and

opportunities linked to the investment. Alecta also sees dialogue as an important tool

for following up in cases where companies deviate from our expectations related to ESG

or sustainability. This applies to both equity investments and the financing of

companies through bonds.

Dialogue is also part of our work with other asset classes and when we invest with

external managers. Here, the dialogue contributes to our analysis of the underlying

assets and of the external managers' ESG processes, which promotes increased

transparency and relevant disclosure on their part.

Alecta shall act independently in its corporate governance and is not part of any

ownership sphere. Alecta conducts a dialogue on its own but may also engage together

with other investors when there are ESG issues where joint action increases the

possibility of being heard.

In case of established infringement of international conventions and if a dialogue does

not show positive development over time, Alecta will divest the holding.

Alecta is an engaged owner who uses its shareholder rights at general meetings by

voting in all holdings and actively participating in the work of the nomination

committee in the Swedish listed companies where the ownership justifies it.



4 ESG in different asset classes



4.1 Listed equity

Alecta invests in shares in both listed and unlisted companies, the latter are described

under 4.3 Alternative investments.

Prior to new investments in listed companies as well as in the ongoing management,

ESG aspects are considered, and the holdings are regularly screened based on

international conventions and exclusion criteria described in previous section 2.2.

Positions and exclusions. In the event of serious infringements, a dialogue is initiated

according to point 3.2 Dialogue and engagement above.

Where Alecta's share of ownership warrants this, we actively participate in the

nomination committee work in Swedish companies. Appointing competent, efficient

and well-functioning boards is one of our most important tasks as an owner. We strive

for an even gender distribution of directors, at least 40% of each gender.

Alecta votes at all general meetings of our holdings. We have defined a number of

principles for shareholder engagement, including issues of board composition, capital

structure, remuneration and ESG.



4.1.1 Principles for shareholder engagement

These principles describe how Alecta intends to exercise the corporate governance and

shareholder rights that follow from Alecta's ownership of listed companies and, where

applicable, Alecta's ownership in unlisted companies. Alecta's principles for

shareholder engagement apply to foreign as well as Swedish holdings. The principles

also include work in nomination committees, a Nordic phenomenon in which the

largest owners of a company prepare proposals on board composition for decisions by

shareholders through voting at the General Meeting.

4.1.1.1 Investment strategy equity

Alecta's investment strategy for equity must contribute to the fulfilment of Alecta's

assignment by creating a good and competitive return on Alecta's investment portfolio

within the framework of responsible risk-taking and at low costs. The balance between

financial, environmental and social values is an important prerequisite for long-term

value creation.

To deliver a good and competitive equity return over time, we must identify well-

managed companies with better long-term characteristics than the stock market as an

average. We find these companies through proprietary long-term analysis adapted for

Alecta's needs. We can thereby create a concentrated and balanced portfolio with good

and deep knowledge of a carefully selected number of holdings. Alecta's model with

active management, concentrated portfolios and a long-term ownership is well suited

to Alecta's needs with undertakings that run over a very long period of time.

Alecta integrates shareholder engagement in its investment activities by evaluating the

companies' business models, market potential, sustainability and ownership including

board and management. In addition, the companies' strategy, financial and non-

financial risks are evaluated.

4.1.1.2 Monitoring of shareholder engagement

Alecta monitors its shareholder engagement on relevant issues for the companies

where Alecta is a shareholder. This is done both before a new investment and during

continuous follow-up of Alecta's holdings. The analysis before investment is based on

extensive documentation from many different sources, including the company's own

reporting, external financial analysis, ESG-analysis and dialogue with company

representatives. Day-to-day management monitors the company's performance in all

these aspects in the form of reports, analyst meetings, external analyses, media reports

and matters brought to the general meeting.

Alecta analyses and monitors continuously how the holding companies deliver on their

strategy and how well it corresponds to the company's strategic and operational

challenges in the short and long term. This takes place on an ongoing basis at meetings

with the company and through our own analysis and participation in the companies'

various public presentations.

Financial and non-financial results and risks

Alecta analyse both financial and non-financial results and risks before all new

investments. Thereafter, investments are monitored continuously. Follow-up of the

companies' results and risks based on these parameters is done by Alecta's equity

department.

Capital structure

In our ongoing analysis, Alecta follows the companies' reporting and development of

debt ratio and capital structure. New issues of shares in the companies are occasions

which trigger in-depth analysis. Alecta has a number of fundamental principles on how

companies should handle capital structure issues which are described further down in

section 4.1.1.5 Alecta's position on specific ownership issues.

Social and environmental impact

ESG aspects are included in our ongoing internal analysis. Alecta has developed a

number of principles for social and environmental impact which are described in

section 4.1.1.5 Alecta's position on specific ownership issues. With the support of an

external company specialised in sustainability screening, Alecta reviews our holdings

on an ongoing basis to ensure that the companies do not deviate from our set

principles. The review is carried out for each potential new investment and on a

quarterly basis. In addition, as a basis for our own analysis, Alecta looks at reviews

from other external sources.

Corporate governance

Based on the principles described in section 4.1.1.5 Alecta's position on specific

governance issues, Alecta reviews and analyses all voting matters prior to general

meetings in our holdings, which includes among other things the election of board

members and remuneration programmes. Alecta continuously monitors corporate

governance-related issues in dialogue with representatives of portfolio companies, and

when relevant other stakeholders.

Conflicts of Interest

Alecta works continuously to identify, prevent and manage the conflicts of interest that

may arise between Alecta and its stakeholders. This also applies to Alecta's work with

shareholder engagement. One group of stakeholders to consider in terms of governance

issues are the companies in which Alecta owns shares and with which Alecta also has

other relationships. Alecta's Board has decided on a Conflict of Interest Policy which

includes conflicts of interest regarding governance. If a conflict of interest in Alecta's

shareholder engagement should arise, it must be handled with openness and in

accordance with the Conflict of Interest policy.

4.1.1.3 Corporate governance in Swedish holdings

The conditions for exercising shareholder engagement differ between geographical

markets. As a company with its headquarters in Sweden, Alecta has contributed, and

continues to contribute, to the development of Swedish stewardship and corporate

governance and participates in the work of the nomination committees in the

companies where our ownership justifies it.

Swedish Corporate Governance Code

Swedish limited liability companies are governed by the Swedish Companies Act, the

Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (hereinafter referred to as the Code), the listing

agreement with the marketplace and other applicable regulations. These regulations

create uniform rules for how companies are governed and determine the division of

responsibilities between owners, the board and company management.

Alecta is in favour of all Swedish companies listed on a regulated market in Sweden

applying the Code. However, foreign companies must be able to choose to apply the

corporate governance code which applies in the country where the company is

domiciled, or where the company's shares are primarily listed, see below in section

4.1.1.4 Corporate Governance of Foreign Holdings.

Alecta works to ensure that the Code is as broadly accepted as possible. This is done by

Alecta in part by working to ensure that the companies covered by the Code either

comply with their rules or explain deviations, and in part by working to ensure that the

Code is continuously adjusted to better respond to the needs of the owners and

companies.

Alecta participates in the further development of the Code primarily through its

membership in the Institutional Owners Association.

Participation in the nomination committee work

Alecta's work in nomination committees is based on our long-term commitment as

owner, our principles for shareholder engagement and our belief the companies.

The nomination committees shall work for board evaluations as a practice. Alecta

believes that professional evaluations should form the basis for the work of the

nomination committee, partly to improve the work of the board, and partly to be able to

replace members that no longer correspond to the requirements for being included in

the board of the individual company. In addition to the information provided by the

chairman of the board, the nomination committees should also interview individual

board members.

Alecta's representatives on the nomination committee shall contribute to ensuring that

the work of the nomination committee is based on an assessment that takes each

company's strategic and operational challenges as a starting point and that the search

for new candidates is based on the boards need of qualifications set out in a

requirements profile. Alecta's nomination committee shall also work to ensure that

there is a succession plan for each board.

In line with the Code, Alecta supports initiatives to broaden the recruitment base of

qualified candidates for board positions and thus promotes diversity in the board. We

strive for an even gender distribution of directors of at least 40% of each gender.

4.1.1.4 Corporate governance in foreign holdings

Alecta is in favour of all Swedish companies listed on a regulated market in Sweden

applying the Code. However, foreign companies must be able to choose to apply the

corporate governance code which applies in the country where the company is

domiciled, or where the company's shares are primarily listed. Regulations governing

the exercise of shareholder engagement have as a rule grown on each capital market

and deviations between these markets are common. The composition of nomination

committees in foreign companies usually does not consist of owners but of independent

directors of the board. Alecta's conditions for shareholder engagement in foreign

companies are thus different compared to the influence exercised in Swedish

companies.

4.1.1.5 Alecta's position on specific governance issues

Board composition

Alecta believes that the boards should have predominantly independent directors. The

CEO and Chairman shall not be the same person even if there are jurisdictions that

allow it.

When board members are appointed, this must be determined by the company’s need

for experience and skills/competence. Furthermore, the aim should be for the

composition of the board to be characterised by diversity and equality. Our expectation

on portfolio companies is that boards over time should be composed by directors of at

least 40 per cent of each gender. The members shall set aside time for the assignment

to the extent required to safeguard the interests of the company and its shareholders.

Board fees

Alecta believes that the board's remuneration should be based on the responsibility and

commitment expected of the members and that the remuneration should meet market

conditions. To avoid conflicts of interest, board members should not be covered by

incentive programmes that are designed for the companies’ employees. The board's

task is to design, decide and monitor the effects of such incentive programmes.

Remuneration of employees and senior executives

The remuneration of senior executives must be well justified, transparent and market-

based. Market-based means that consideration is given to the local market where the

company is domiciled. Alecta may vote against proposals for compensation

programmes if they can be perceived as conflicting with the shareholders' long-term

interests.

Alecta believes that it is the board’s responsibility that the company has a well-thought-

out and relevant compensation policy. It must be understandable and transparent.

Compensation shall be viewed as a whole consisting of a fixed and, where applicable,

variable salary, share-related incentive programme, pension provisions and other

significant benefits.

The Board must be able to justify and defend the remuneration strategy both to

shareholders and customers as well as the general public as a whole. The balance

between economic, environmental and social values is fundamental for long-term value

creation. ESG-matters that are material for a company’s long-term financial value

creation shall be reflected in the remuneration program. The remuneration systems –

variable compensation included - must be easy to explain and understand. They shall

be market-based and performance-based and be in accordance with the shareholders’

and the company's long-term interests. Performance criteria must be challenging and

measurable.

Share or share price-related incentive programmes shall be decided by the general

meeting. The programmes must be limited in time and they should contain information

on so-called ceilings and any dilution of existing stock. Prior to a resolution at the

general meeting, the Board shall report in detail which costs the programmes may

entail for shareholders and otherwise justify the benefits of the programmes. As part of

this report, previous programmes should also be reviewed.

Information from the companies on remuneration programmes to senior executives

shall be anchored with the owners by the Board well in advance so that the owners are

given sufficient time to discuss and submit change proposals before the General

Meeting.

Alecta believes that the pension provision for senior executives should be defined

contribution.

Shareholding

Alecta is in favour of employees, management and board members of listed companies

acquiring shares in the company on a voluntary basis and on market terms.

Capital structure issues

The board and management are responsible for ensuring that the company has an

efficient and effective capital structure that promotes the company's development in

both the short and long term. If capital needs to be contributed or distributed, Alecta

considers that the basic principle should be that existing shareholders are treated

equally.

New issue of shares should primarily be issued with priority given to the company's

existing shareholders. When the Board finds it justified to deviate from existing

shareholders' preferential rights, for example in the case of directed new issues or

issues in kind, a detailed justification by the Board is required. Authorisation for the

Board to decide on directed share issues requires a detailed justification and

Policy document owner

Decided

12 (15)



description of the situations and conditions under which such authorisation is to be

used. In cases of directed share issuance, the Board shall inform of the reasons for

deviating from preferential rights, as well as how the subscription price has been

determined and how fair market value is ensured.

In cases where the Board proposes a distribution of capital, this should primarily be

done through extra cash dividends or redemption of shares.

The repurchase of the company’s own shares should be viewed against the background

that it is the board's responsibility to have a balanced capital structure. Proposals to

repurchase the company’s own shares must be well justified, as must the conditions for

the use of any authorisation.

Barriers to acquisition

For proposals regarding the introduction of rules into or outside the articles of

association for the purpose of preventing or making acquisitions more difficult, Alecta

intends to vote against.

Environment, business ethics and social issues

Alecta believes that a sound approach to environment, business ethics and social issues

is a prerequisite for companies to be able to achieve persistently good competitiveness

and sustainable profitability. This means that companies must act in accordance with

rules, conventions and laws and in addition develop and maintain a sound corporate

culture that permeates the business. Alecta shall work towards companies having

appropriate guidelines, clear targets, resources and action plans for improvement

measures as well as a transparent reporting of their work with environmental, business

ethics and social issues.

Alecta expects the portfolio companies to comply with international conventions and

agreements, including conventions on the environment, human rights, employment

rights, corruption and controversial weapons, as well as initiatives such as the UN

Global Compact10, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the

OECD guidelines for multinational companies11. The responsibility applies regardless of

whether the countries in which the companies operate are signatories to the

conventions or have weaker legislation.

Alecta continuously assess the portfolio companies to ensure that the companies are

not violating these principles. If a company in which Alecta has invested acts

questionable within a sustainability area, a dialogue should be initiated with the

company concerned. The purpose of the dialogue is for the company to clarify its



10 Includes principles directed at companies on human rights, labour rights, the environment and

corruption. The principles are based on the UN declaration of human rights, the ILO's core conventions on

fundamental principles and rights at work, the Rio declaration and the UN's convention against corruption.

11 OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises are joint recommendations to companies from 40

governments. The recommendations partly overlap with the UN Global Compact, but also include aspects

of how companies should handle information disclosure, consumer interests, science and technology,

competition and taxation.

approach in the relevant area and, if necessary, adopt measures for improvement. If the

dialogue does not achieve the intended results or if it is not considered possible to

achieve an improvement, Alecta might chose to divest its holding in the company.



4.2 Fixed income assets

Alecta invests in various fixed income, or interest-bearing assets that fall within the

categories described below.



4.2.1 Corporate bonds

The analysis process for corporate bonds is similar to that of equity investments. Prior

to financing and in the current management, ESG aspects are considered, and the

holdings are regularly screened for example based on international conventions and

our exclusion criteria described in previous section 2.2. Positions and exclusions. In the

event of serious deviations, a dialogue is initiated by Alecta or our partner, with clear

expectations of actions by the company. A dialogue that does not show development

over time means that Alecta can choose not to continue to finance the company.



4.2.2 Other direct issuers of bonds

Alecta also invests in bonds from municipalities, states, and supranational bodies. Here

the ESG aspects are considered before the investment and Alecta refrains from

financing governments in accordance with the limitations stated in section 2.2.3

Exclusions.



4.3 Alternative investments

Alecta's definition of Alternative Investments includes real estate, infrastructure and

alternative credits that carry higher market risks than traditional fixed-income

investments. Unlisted companies are included in Alternative Investments.

Alecta invests in real estate mainly through the subsidiary Alecta Fastigheter, but also

through externally managed funds. Infrastructure assets or alternative credits may also

be managed externally.



4.3.1 Real estate

Alecta's ownership in Swedish real estate is managed through the wholly-owned

subsidiary Alecta Fastigheter. Alecta Fastigheter's operations are covered by Alecta's

overall sustainability goals and policy documents through an ownership directive.

Through the subsidiary, Alecta is invested in joint ventures or associated companies.

These are primarily controlled via shareholder agreements with co-investors and

through board representation. Here, Alecta strives for the associated companies to have

sustainability work at least in line with Alecta's own.

Alecta invests in foreign real estate assets primarily through externally managed funds,

and through associated companies. See 4.3.5.

investments. See 4.3.5.



4.3.3 Alternative credits

There are structured fixed income assets that are classified as alternatives, these assets

are often managed by external managers. See 4.3.5.



4.3.4 Private equity

The process for direct investment in private equity follows the same principles as

described for listed equity regarding consideration of ESG and screening, as well as for

dialogue both proactively and in the event of deviations. However, the availability of

public information differs for non-listed equity compared to listed holdings and in

certain non-listed holdings, Alecta cannot exercise voting rights.

As an exception Alecta invests in externally managed private equity funds, see 4.3.5.



4.3.5 External asset management

For externally managed assets described in sections 4.3.1. – 4.3.4, the manager's ESG

processes are reviewed, and underlying assets are screened as far as possible.

Assessment of whether and how deviation from our ESG criteria may occur must be

documented and well-motivated. At a minimum, the threshold values for excluded

sectors specified in section 2.2.3 Exclusions shall be applied at the fund or portfolio

level. The same principles apply to instruments used for risk management purposes,

such as share index futures and exchange-traded fund shares.



5 Control and reporting

The Head of Investment Management is responsible for upholding the principles

in this policy before investment decisions and during the management of the assets12.

reviewed by an external party13.

The Corporate Governance and ESG group is responsible for regular reviews of

the investment portfolio. The results from screenings as well as annual follow-up of the

overall climate objective and other corporate governance indicators are reported in

internal forums and to the board.

Alecta must be open and transparent regarding responsible investments with a focus on

corporate governance, shareholder engagement and ESG. The work is reported and

monitored annually in a number of publications;
