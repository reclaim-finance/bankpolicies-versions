Responsible Investment Guideline



Policy of Munich Re Group

Version: 1 January 2026

2



1 Objective



This Responsible Investment Guideline (RIG) outlines the general framework for Group investment activities,

setting out responsible standards and requirements that are to be upheld within Munich Re Group in order to

implement sustainability in our investment strategy, taking sustainability criteria into account. The measures

described in this document aim at supporting our progress towards fulfilling our Group Climate Ambition.



As Munich Re Group is aware of its responsibility and influence as a large asset owner and investor, the

integration of sustainability criteria is a key element of our investment strategy. We use both general sustainability

criteria, which are explained in our sustainability reporting (e.g., climate, biodiversity and human rights), and

specific sustainability criteria tailored to individual asset classes (e.g., energy efficiency or ESG ratings).



Munich Re Group was one of the first signatories of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and is

committed to clear greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. Moreover, Munich Re Group was part of the Net

Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) before it decided to leave the alliance in June 2025. We are convinced that

we are be able to pursue our climate targets in a more focused and targeted manner on our own. Further details

on this decision can be found in our public statement 1 . In addition to these targets, the climate tackling

investments that Munich Re Group pursues are intended to generate a positive, sustainable effect alongside

financial returns.



2 Scope of application



2.1 Entities in scope



This Guideline is directly applicable to Munich Reinsurance Company and ERGO Group AG, including its

branches and representative offices. All Munich Re and ERGO Group entities with licenses for primary insurance

or reinsurance and our internal asset managers (MEAG AMG, Munich Re Investment Partners) are required to

implement the objectives, principles and requirements as stipulated herein by adopting this Guideline or

introducing an equivalent norm, or by other adequate means. As concerns third-party asset managers, we strive

to reach a contractual agreement on the application of this Guideline or a comparable standard.



2.2 Assets in scope



The RIG applies to the investment of Munich Re Group’s proprietary assets, irrespective of whether they are

managed by Munich Re or ERGO themselves, by Group Investment Management (GIM), by our internal asset

managers or by a third party.



This Guideline focuses on direct investments in the asset classes of equities, corporates, government and

covered bonds, and in alternative investments, with minor exceptions as detailed below. We aim to extend the

scope of the RIG to encompass all assets wherever possible, depending on various factors such as asset-class

characteristics, industry standards, and the constantly evolving data and analytics environment. We will review

the Guideline at least every two years.



The RIG does not apply to any assets/derivatives in the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)

categories “Insurance-related financial instruments” and “Investments for unit-linked insurance”. These assets



1 https://www.munichre.com/en/company/media-relations/statements/2025/statement-2025-06-06.html

3



held or derivatives used to manage, cover or hedge reinsurance financial structures, products sold as risk

management solutions or finance products for non-Group clients are instead subject to the guidelines applicable

to Munich Re Group’s insurance business.



For mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs), it is not feasible to negotiate the inclusion of specific

restrictions with the manager, and transparency on the funds’ contents is limited. Therefore, due care must be

taken in the selection process before buying mutual funds and ETFs. We analyse sustainability criteria, such as

Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) ratings and other available data, to ensure a best-effort approach

to the selection process.



2.3 Overarching, important remarks



In cases involving indirect investments (fund investments), or investments via non-Group asset managers,

Munich Re Group has limited transparency and influence regarding the enforcement of the RIG requirements.

Hence, compliance with the requirements described in this Guideline, e.g. exclusions and restrictions, cannot be

fully ensured.

We aim to identify these cases and to apply sustainability processes to them as far as feasible. If this is not

possible, Munich Re Group may still choose to invest if the counterparty provides a written justification (e.g. via

email) explaining why an exclusion is not feasible, along with relevant policies or explanations of their general

approach or processes that meet our standards.



For alternative investments, if a specific exclusion is not possible, this has to be made transparent in the GIM

Alternative Investments Investment Committee (GIM AIIC). For private equity and private debt funds, the asset

manager should make best efforts to negotiate the inclusion of the relevant restrictions in the fund and document

their efforts, or encourage the fund manager to include our exclusions and restrictions in the production/portfolio

selection process.



In an exceptional case where data from external providers is demonstrated to be outdated, inaccurate

(deficient, incorrect, misleading) or incomplete, we may conduct a comprehensive assessment, involving our

internal research analysts and additional reliable data sources, to ensure a solid basis for decision-making. This

may result in changes to our exclusion list, e.g. additional exclusions of or exclusion exceptions for affected

issuers.



We implement our exclusions on issuers for which we detect a unique identifier that is suitable for

implementation by our asset managers.

4



3 Governance



Strategic decisions on sustainability in investments are made by the Board of Management (BoM) in the ESG

Committee (ESG C), supported by the ESG Management Team (ESG MT). On the investment side, the ESG

Investment Committee (ESG IC) focuses specifically on the implementation of the sustainability strategy in

investments. In addition, the GIM AIIC focuses, in particular, on matters related to alternative assets.



As a member of the Board of Management, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) is responsible for the Group's

investment management. The GIM division, which reports to the CIO, is the asset owner function responsible for

the Group’s sustainable investment strategy and has set up its own GIM Sustainability in Investments team

(GIM1.1.4) for this purpose. Besides this team, there are dedicated sustainability teams at our internal asset

managers MEAG and Munich Re Investment Partners.



In order to anchor the topic of sustainability in our investment processes, the GIM Sustainability in Investments

team is supported by ESG multipliers throughout GIM. This structure is also mirrored in asset management at

MEAG, which manages a large proportion of our investments. The implementation of our sustainability strategy

at MEAG is supported by the membership of MEAG representatives in GIM’s ESG IC. It is further strengthened

by the ongoing exchange of information between the sustainability teams in the segment of investments and by

the ESG multipliers within various portfolio management teams.



Munich Re Group understands reputational risk as a risk of possible damage to Munich Re Group’s reputation,

which arises as a consequence of a negative public perception, or a deterioration in rating or company value,

etc. Reputational risk committees have been established for each business segment across ERGO, MEAG and

Munich Re. These committees, if approached with a reputational risk case in their area of responsibility, review

the matter and decide whether such planned transactions are appropriate. The GIM Reputational Risk Committee

(GIM RRC) supports our efforts to address sustainability risks holistically by analysing and assessing reputational

risks as they relate to investments. Sensitive issues that could lead to reputational risks have to be dealt with by

adhering to the risk management and compliance processes. The GIM RRC gets involved if a reputational risk

is indicated regarding individual investments as far as Munich Re Group has the power to direct individual

transactions, or investment-related documents that are negotiated with asset managers. For cases, especially

those involving (potential) breaches of the norm, the respective compliance unit has to be contacted.



The existing processes as set out in the Risk Management Directive, Compliance Directive, and Compliance

Guideline, as well as its related rules of procedure must be complied with. This also applies in the event of

potential reputational risks.



4 Approach to sustainability



The systematic integration of sustainability criteria into our investment management activities is fundamental to

our investment strategy which comprises four key elements: systematic integration of sustainability criteria into

the investment processes; clearly defined exclusion and restriction criteria; selected climate tackling investments,

including renewable energy and certified real estate investments; and stewardship activities, including

engagement and proxy voting. In addition, we require that all our asset managers apply sustainability criteria

when managing our portfolios.



We are convinced that integrating sustainability criteria into investment decisions contributes to a better, more

holistic risk management of the assets we own or invest in. We believe sustainability integration leads to higher

risk-adjusted returns in the long term. We combine various approaches to the integration of sustainability criteria

5



across our investment value chain, from strategic asset allocation to asset management, such as climate tackling

investments (which aim, for example, to contribute to climate change mitigation, see section 4.4.1), norm-based

exclusion criteria (e.g., Thermal Coal or human rights), holistic stewardship practices, and the inclusion of

sustainability criteria in financial analysis. This helps us to identify risks and opportunities beyond standard

financial analysis.



Our sustainability teams within GIM and at our internal asset managers work closely with sustainability experts

when integrating sustainability aspects into our investment processes. External data providers supply us with

issuer-specific ESG ratings, KPIs (e.g., GHG emissions data), and issuer-specific screening of business activities

and controversies, according to our needs. We use relevant research data in our financial analysis to better

understand sustainability risks and opportunities, and as input when screening investments regarding specific

sustainability topics as well as exclusion criteria. They also serve as input for screening the majority of our assets

for specific sustainability criteria.



4.1 Integration of sustainability criteria



We integrate sustainability criteria into the investment process via corresponding data and analysis. Given the

dynamic and evolving nature of the sustainability landscape, we continuously monitor emerging sustainability

topics and changing regulatory requirements.

At Munich Re Group, sustainability criteria are part of the M\&A process when considering investments in new

strategic participations, within the strategic fit assessment and, when deemed relevant, as part of the due

diligence.



The following topics are especially important to us when integrating sustainability aspects into our investment

decisions:



Biodiversity

The urgent need to address biodiversity loss and its implications for asset owners cannot be overstated. The

growing concern over the extent of biodiversity loss has led to a heightened focus on this issue in sustainability

discussions at the corporate level. As companies face increasing scrutiny and pressure to disclose their

environmental risks, asset owners are also recognising the relevance of biodiversity in their investment decisions.



Controversial weapons

Weapons-related business is a sensitive international topic. Munich Re Group pursues a prudent approach and

carefully assesses any potential impacts that such business might have on our reputation. The Group has made

a commitment to not supporting businesses that do not fully comply with international conventions. Hence, we

exclude investments in issuers involved in controversial weapons categories that are considered to cause

unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to combatants or to affect civilians indiscriminately and that are deemed

inhumane by international conventions.



Food-related transactions

Munich Re Group takes a critical view of investments in food-related commodities from a sustainability

perspective, as they may cause social imbalances.



Human rights

With its Declaration of Principles on the Respect and Protection of Human Rights, Munich Re Group has

expressed the importance of human rights and the high priority they have for the entire Group. This means that

6



we underpin our understanding of responsibility for human rights by adhering to international guidelines and

standards.



Oil \& Gas

The Oil \& Gas sector increasingly needs to understand the implications of the energy transition for its operations

and business models, and to demonstrate the contributions it can make to reducing GHG emissions and

achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Our dedicated emission reduction targets are elaborated in the next

chapter.



Oil Sands

The detrimental effects of extracting oil from Oil Sands (also known as tar sands) can be significant for the

environment and local communities. Among other things, extracting oil from Oil Sands consumes more energy

and resources than the extraction and refining of conventional oil, and it is among the most carbon-intensive

methods of crude oil production. Our dedicated emission reduction targets are elaborated in the next chapter.



Thermal Coal

Since power generated by Thermal Coal is responsible for a large part of all emissions from the energy sector

globally, we see reducing Thermal Coal as a major accelerator for reaching net zero. The firing of Thermal Coal

for energy is the single largest contributor to the man-made global temperature increase (see “Position Paper:

Thermal Coal” by the NZAOA2). Our dedicated emission reduction targets are elaborated in the next chapter.



4.2 Target setting: Munich Re Group Climate Ambition 2030



In December 2025, as part of our Climate Ambition 2030, Munich Re Group set new climate targets until year-

end 2030. Regarding investments, these consist of three target categories: The first category comprises our

decarbonization targets for the asset classes listed enterprises, real estate equity (third-party use incl. funds) and

direct infrastructure, together with direct private equity, and direct private debt, and for the sectors Thermal Coal

(phase-out) and Oil \& Gas. These targets are measured against the base year 2025 if not stated otherwise. The

second category is a volume build-up target for climate tackling investments, which are described in section 4.4.1.

The third category encompasses an absolute engagement target for high emission investments (sum since

2020). In addition, we aim to reduce GHG emissions from our investment portfolio to net zero by 2050. Munich

Re Group expresses the above-stated 2030 targets, and 2050 aims in the expectation that governments meet

their own pledges to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. More information can be found on the Munich Re

website or in our press release on 11 December 2025.

4.3 Exclusions and restrictions



We define exclusions from, and restrictions on, the investment universe to avoid undesirable activities that do

not fit our sustainability strategy. Exclusions are measures by which we explicitly do not invest in selective issuers

due to sustainability concerns, whereas for restrictions, certain pre-conditions need to be fulfilled before we invest

in specific issuers. The applicability of the measures described in the following chapters is subject to the

overarching, important remarks outlined in section 2.3.



4.3.1 Regarding liquid assets



Exclusions are implemented using the centrally managed “listed issuer exclusion lists”3 based on our negative

screening process and criteria, which are binding for all of our asset managers. The GIM Sustainability in

Investments team reviews the lists of excluded issuers on a quarterly basis to the best of their knowledge

regarding the screened issuers. Exclusions and restrictions are applicable to either listed equities, corporate

bonds, commodities, and sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and government agencies, or several of these asset

classes as described below. The applicability of the measures described in the following chapters is

subject to the overarching, important remarks outlined in section 2.3.



4.3.1.1 Listed equity and corporate bonds



4.3.1.1.1 Controversial weapons



Munich Re Group rules out direct investments in equities or bonds of issuers verifiably involved in controversial

weapons and key components through their own operations, through a subsidiary (majority ownership/controlling

shareholder), through a joint venture (regardless of ownership stake) or as a bond issuer issuing debt for a

company that is verifiably involved in controversial weapons. This refers to companies which are verifiably

involved in the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, or transfer of controversial weapons,

as well as assistance in any of these activities. We define controversial weapons according to the following

weapon categories:

• Anti-personnel mines

• Cluster munitions

• Biological weapons

• Chemical weapons

• Blinding laser weapons

• Incendiary weapons (excluding white phosphorus weapons)

• Non-detectable fragments



3 We implement our exclusions for issuers for which we detect a unique identifier that is suitable for implementation at our asset managers.

4.3.1.1.2 Human rights



In order to integrate human rights considerations into our investment decisions, we conduct a Group-wide risk

analysis: A norm-based screening by which external data is assessed and validated internally, leading to a list of

excluded companies.

This due diligence process, steered by the Munich Re Group Sustainability Department (Munich Re Group

Human Rights Officer), involves a scoring methodology consisting of various human rights-related factors, such

as human trafficking and forced labour. Direct investments in equities and bonds issued by these excluded

companies showing significant human rights violations are not permitted. The methodology for identifying such

companies is continuously revised. GIM monitors the portfolio regularly and evaluates remedial measures in the

case of an ad-hoc event.



Figure 2: Decision tree for human rights for companies (liquid assets)



Exclusion

9



4.3.1.1.3 Oil \& Gas



We screen companies in the Oil \& Gas sector and analyse the intensity and development of their GHG emissions.

For the sector target, we use the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sub-Industries. For the purposes

of calculating our GHG footprint, we define relevant Oil and Gas sectors as Oil \& Gas Exploration \& Production,

Oil \& Gas Refining \& Marketing, Oil \& Gas Drilling, and Integrated Oil \& Gas.

In order to further facilitate the achievement of the Paris Climate Agreement’s goals, we ceased to make new

direct investments in pure-play Oil \& Gas companies. We define these companies as listed companies within the

GICS Oil \& Gas Subindustries, except those in the Integrated Oil \& Gas sector.



For new investments, we require a credible commitment from listed Integrated Oil \& Gas companies to net zero

GHG emissions by 2050, including corresponding short- and mid-term milestones. These companies are selected

and assessed based on data provided by Institutional Shareholder Service (ISS) ESG, a recognised provider of

sustainability-related data analysis.



Exceptions apply for green bonds and engagement under specific conditions:

We may invest in green bonds issued by Oil \& Gas companies which are compliant with an accredited green

bond framework (by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles or the EU Green

Bond Standard) and have been assessed by an external review provider. Under specific conditions, GIM

Sustainability in Investments may decide to engage with companies in line with the approach outlined in section

4.5 rather than ceasing to invest.



Exclusion

10

4.3.1.1.4 Oil Sands



Munich Re Group does not invest directly in equities or bonds issued by companies that derive more than 10% of

their revenues from Oil Sands extraction. We may invest in green bonds issued by Oil Sands companies which

are compliant with an accredited green bond framework (by the ICMA Green Bond Principles or the EU Green

Bond Standard), and have been assessed by an external review provider.



Exclusion

11



Figure 4: Decision tree for Oil Sands (liquid assets)



4.3.1.1.5 Thermal Coal



For Thermal Coal, we apply two types of exclusions:

First, relative exclusion criteria where we rule out direct investments in listed equities or corporate bonds of

companies that:

▪ derive more than 15% of their revenues from Thermal Coal mining and/or the generation of electricity from

Thermal Coal firing.

Second, absolute exclusion criteria where we rule out direct investments in listed equities or corporate bonds

of companies that:

▪ have an annual Thermal Coal production above 10 megatons (Mt), or

▪ have an installed coal-fired generation capacity above 5 gigawatts (GW).

▪ Exceptions apply for companies, affected by absolute exclusion criteria regarding coal production and

installed capacity, that have a credible commitment to net zero GHG emissions by 2050, including

corresponding short- and mid-term milestones. These companies are selected and assessed based on data

provided by ISS ESG.



For both types of exclusion, an exception for green bonds and engagement applies under specific conditions.

In order to support the transition to a low-carbon economy and to finance the issuer’s transition, green bonds

issued by affected companies remain investable subject to specific requirements: the green bond must be

compliant with an accredited Green Bond Framework (by the ICMA Green Bond Principles or EU Green Bond

Standard) and assessed by an external review provider.



In selected cases (companies meeting absolute KPI exclusions and companies with relative revenue thresholds

between 15 % and 30%), GIM Sustainability in Investments may decide to engage with companies in line with

the approach outlined in section 4.5 rather than ceasing to invest.



Exclusion

12

4.3.1.2 Bonds from sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and government agencies



4.3.1.2.1 ESG country rating



Direct investments in sovereigns, sub-sovereigns, and government agencies of countries rated “CCC” by MSCI

(ESG Rating scale AAA-CCC) are not permitted.



4.3.1.2.2 Human rights



For sovereign, sub-sovereign and government agency risk analysis, we apply a country-specific human rights

score based on data from an external provider and taking into account factors such as modern slavery, forced

labour and child labour.

We monitor our portfolio accordingly and exclude countries with extreme risks. GIM regularly monitors the

exposure to countries with high risk. The methodology regarding the country-specific human rights score is

continuously revised.



If there is any indication of increased reputational risk for countries that have not yet been sanctioned, the Board

of Management may decide to exclude them.

4.3.1.3 Commodities



4.3.1.3.1 Food-related transactions



We do not trade or hold investments in food-related commodities (e.g. grains and oilseeds, livestock, dairy, etc.)

or related derivatives. This prohibition does not apply to the farming and/or leasing of farmland or forest, including

typical and usual risk management instruments in the agricultural and forestry industries (e.g. forward sales,

currency hedging, variety licenses).

4.3.2 Regarding alternative assets



We integrate sustainability criteria into the investment processes for alternative asset classes as described below,

and we continuously aspire to provide “best effort” sustainability processes as far as feasible. In the field of

alternative assets, we have defined climate tackling investments that aim to contribute to climate change

mitigation, for example (see section 4.4.1).



When making new direct alternative investments via our internal asset manager MEAG, we assess the

investments as part of the due diligence process using sustainability criteria. The sustainability assessment is

also part of the risk management second opinion compiled by MEAG. The MEAG ESG \& Sustainable Finance

department is involved in the due diligence process. When making the investment decision, key findings of the

sustainability assessment are presented to the GIM AIIC.



For the following alternative assets, we apply certain exclusions or require certain standards (restrictions) as

listed per sub-asset class below. The applicability of the measures described in the following chapters is

subject to the overarching, important remarks outlined in section 2.3.



4.3.2.1 Infrastructure investments



4.3.2.1.1 Biodiversity



We conduct a review of alternative investments, except private equity and private debt funds, using the Integrated

Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) as part of the due diligence process. IBAT provides commercial users with

spatial data on biodiversity globally from several key datasets, such as natural and mixed UN World Heritage

Sites (as defined by the UNESCO World Heritage Convention).

We do not make direct alternative majority investments via our internal asset managers if a material portion of

the underlying assets is situated in a natural or mixed World Heritage Site. In ambiguous cases (e.g. regarding

materiality), the GIM AIIC is informed and may involve the GIM RRC.

4.3.2.1.2 Controversial weapons



With regard to alternative investments, we do not invest in any infrastructure assets that are verifiably involved in

the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention or transfer of controversial weapons according to

our definition4.



Figure 9: Decision tree for controversial weapons (alternative assets)



4 Controversial weapons categories are defined as anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, biological weapons, chemical weapons, blinding laser

weapons, incendiary weapons (excl. white phosphorus weapons), and non-detectable fragments.



Exclusion

16



4.3.2.1.3 Human rights



When making new direct infrastructure investments through our internal asset managers, we consider a list of

human rights-specific requirements as part of the due diligence process. Any significant controversial indicators

of human rights violations are reported to the GIM AIIC prior to taking an investment decision. The GIM AIIC may

involve the GIM RRC.



Checklist for human rights

Adherence to human rights principles throughout the due diligence process (ESG Criteria Evaluation

tools, etc.)

For indirect investments, integration of human rights principles in side letters

Reporting of any controversies indicating violations of human rights to the GIM AIIC prior to taking an

investment decision. The GIM AIIC may involve the GIM RRC.



4.3.2.1.4 Oil \& Gas



As of 1 April 2023, we no longer invest in assets exclusively covering the planning, financing, construction or

operation of

• new Oil \& Gas fields in which, as at 31 December 2022 no prior production had taken place,

• new midstream infrastructure related to oil, which was not yet under construction or in operation as at 31

December 2022,

• new oil fired power plants, which were not yet under construction or in operation as at 31 December 2022.



Furthermore, we do not invest in new gas infrastructure (not under construction or in operation as at 1 December

2024) unless it aims to be in line with 1.5°C low/no overshoot pathways. Direct investments in Oil \& Gas

exploration and drilling within the Arctic region, as specified by the AMAP (Arctic Monitoring and Assessment

Programme) and AHDR (Arctic Human Development Report), are prohibited.



Checklist for Oil \& Gas

4.3.2.2 Forestry \& agriculture investments



4.3.2.2.1 Certifications



Sustainability considerations are comprehensively integrated into the investment process. Environmental, climate

change and biodiversity aspects, as well as human rights and workforce safety issues, are among the major

topics considered.



For forestry investments, we focus on the asset managers/property managers and analyse their respective

certifications, placing specific demands on them: Munich Re Group stipulates that asset managers/property

managers must ensure that the management of all Certifiable Forestry Investments is certified by the Forest

Stewardship Council (FSC), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), or an equivalent,

within 5 years of acquisition. Forestry investments that do not meet this requirement are prohibited.



Figure 12: Decision tree for forestry (alternative assets)



4.3.2.2.2 Sustainability specifics in the due diligence process



For each new direct forestry \& agriculture investment made by the internal asset manager, detailed “ESG Criteria

Evaluation for Forestry Investments” and “ESG Criteria Evaluation for Agricultural Investments” questionnaires

are applied, shedding light on sustainability aspects, including biodiversity and human rights. Moreover, Munich

Re Group’s internal assessment framework is applied, covering physical climate risks.

4.3.2.3.1 RIG requirements for indirect investment products



For indirect investment products (fund investments), compliance with RIG requirements cannot be ensured. For

private equity and private debt funds, the asset manager should make and document best efforts to negotiate

the inclusion of the relevant requirements in the fund documentation or encourage the fund manager to include

these requirements in the production/portfolio selection process.



4.3.2.3.2 GP’s PRI signature or sustainability policy



For our new investments in private equity, private debt and infrastructure funds, we check whether the general

partner (GP) has signed the PRI or whether the GP has its own sustainability policy. We take this into account

when deciding on the selection of the GP. Depending on the product/investment, this is handled by either GIM

or MEAG. We also inform the GP about additional restrictions as per this Guideline and our desire to include

these in a side letter.

4.3.2.4.1.1.1 Sustainability specifics in the due diligence process



We require our internal asset managers to pre-screen for certain sustainability criteria for new direct real estate

investments as part of environmental due diligence during the acquisition process. In addition, an internal ESG

assessment is carried out using an ESG Criteria Evaluation tool, including selected key E, S and G criteria.

Wherever possible, a GHG footprint should be available for the investment.



Please see the listed measures and implementation processes in the key topic areas.

4.3.2.4.1.2.1 Specific requirements for third-party asset managers



When it comes to third-party asset managers, we focus on managers who have integrated sustainability

considerations across the investment lifecycle. The definition of real estate-specific sustainability roles and

responsibilities is a requirement. Investment strategies have to comply with a set of minimum sustainability criteria

(e.g. Green Building certification). An ESG rating like the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB)

is an advantage.



4.3.2.4.1.3 Real estate debt (mortgages)



4.3.2.4.1.3.1 Sustainability specifics in the lending policy



The sustainability approach to real estate debt is focused on sustainability selection criteria.

Being a debt lender, however, implies no direct access to the underlying real estate assets, which is why a

meaningful sustainability assessment depends on the quality of the data provided by the investor/owner of the

building.

Please see the listed measures and implementation processes in the key topic areas.

4.3.3 Third party asset managers



4.3.3.1 Selection process



Munich Re Group only works with asset managers with dedicated sustainability capabilities, and only selects

asset managers that are UN PRI signatories or are in the process of becoming one. Exceptions are decided on

by GIM RRC.



Figure 13: Decision tree for third party asset manager selection



A Request for Proposal (RfP) must be filled out by potential asset managers, outlining their sustainability

capabilities, strategy and research approach. It also covers the individual approach, where applicable, regarding

engagements, as well as GHG footprint measurement, decarbonisation, biodiversity and human rights within the

investment process. GHG emission reporting capabilities are required for markets/asset classes where relevant

data of a sufficient quality is available. The evaluation of the RfP is followed by a detailed dialogue with the asset

managers to further evaluate their sustainability efforts. The ESG policy of the asset manager is also requested.

The selection process continues with an overall scoring of the asset managers, including a dedicated section for

sustainability considerations. Based on this overall scoring, the most suitable asset manager is selected and the

onboarding process begins.



4.3.3.2 Steering and monitoring



For mandates in a liquid asset class, we aim to integrate measures to steer decarbonisation. If these measures

are not met, intensified discussions will be initiated with the asset manager.

The asset managers are monitored on a regular basis, with relevant sustainability-related topics being reviewed

and adherence to exclusions being confirmed by the asset manager. This is done via review meetings at least

on an annual basis by the Asset Manager Selection Team, in exchange with the GIM Sustainability in Investments

Team.



4.3.3.3 Compliance and escalation



In liquid mandates, non-Group managers need to comply with Munich Re Group’s exclusion list in the asset

classes fixed income and equities. The exclusions are then coded into the asset manager’s limit system, where

potential violations will be blocked. If an excluded name is traded, it will result in an active breach of the

Investment Guideline. Corresponding escalation mechanisms are described in the implementation, monitoring

and escalation chapter of this Guideline. The applicability of the measures described in the following

chapters is subject to the overarching, important remarks outlined in section 2.3.



For illiquid mandates, in the contractual negotiations with external asset managers, we aim to include a

reference to the Munich Re Group’s exclusion list. It is the explicit obligation of the asset manager to ensure

23



strict adherence to contractual agreements. In the event of non-compliance, the asset manager shall take

immediate corrective action to remedy the situation and notify GIM. Failure to do so will result in the mandate

being categorically downgraded to “red” status, as reflected in GIM’s quarterly internal reviews, and a formal

alert will be issued to AIIC via a red light note. The next steps will be agreed and implemented jointly.



4.4 Sustainability-related financial instruments



4.4.1 Climate tackling investments



We refer to investments that aim to positively contribute to our sustainable investment strategy as climate tackling

investments. Currently, these include energy-related investments, certified real estate investments and certified

forestry management investments.



4.4.1.1 Energy-related investments



By thematic investing, we seek to increase our energy-related investments to promote the energy transition.

Energy-related investments include selected investments in projects, companies and technologies that aim to

facilitate the reduction of GHG emissions by improving the production, management, distribution or use of energy,

heat and power. This includes, but is not limited to, renewables, energy efficiency, electro-mobility, storage

technologies, heat supply and grids.



4.4.1.2 Certified real estate investments



We define certified real estate investments as those which are certified by EU Green Building, Building Research

Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design

(LEED), Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen (DGNB) or that have other equivalent certifications. If an

existing certification expires, re-certification will be commissioned in due time. In cases where a higher level of

certification is required or achievable, additional measures may be implemented. Assets undergoing a re-

certification process will continue to be considered as certified.



New direct real estate investments must obtain an ecolabel or a recognised level of certification. If an investment

property is not certified, the asset manager must determine the measures required for certification and factor in

the costs of these measures into the cash flow base case to initiate the certification process.



It is also necessary to ensure compatibility of optimisation/refurbishment work with sustainability aspects on

existing properties. Measures to achieve the certifications mentioned are highly recommended in order to improve

the sustainability of the existing portfolio.



4.4.1.3 Certified forestry management investments



We define forest investments as sustainable if the management has an existing certification by FSC, PEFC or an

equivalent certification. The asset manager assesses each investment individually using sustainability criteria

during the due diligence process.



Sustainability criteria should be promoted and integrated into ongoing management activities. Independent

reviews of applied management practices from FSC, PEFC or equivalent certifiers are of utmost importance, as

they verify ongoing sustainable forest management activities.

24



4.4.2 Green bonds



We understand green bonds as bonds that are linked to investments like renewable energies, sustainable waste

management, biodiversity conservation or sustainable land use according to our data provider. This classification

is based on the issuing documents, stock exchange announcements or information from parties involved in the

issue (e.g. lead managers). Moreover, the green bonds we report on have to be compliant with an accredited

green bond framework (by the ICMA Green Bond Principles or the EU Green Bond Standard) and assessed by

an external review provider.



We will continuously refine this approach to reflect the changing regulatory environment. As outlined under the

restrictions regarding Thermal Coal, Oil Sands and Oil \& Gas above, we may invest in green bonds issued by

companies on our exclusion lists in specific exceptional cases.



4.4.3 Sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) and sustainability-linked loans (SLLs)



We invest in SLBs and SLLs if these instruments are compliant with an accredited green bond framework, i.e.

the ICMA Principles for SLBs and SLLs, and are assessed by an external review provider.



4.5 Stewardship approach



Munich Re Group engages in stewardship activities (mainly via asset managers) to promote high sustainability

standards. This process focuses on:

• engaging with investees/issuers and with our asset managers (please also refer to the section on third-party

asset managers),

• holding them to account on defined material issues, and

• exercising voting rights and responsibilities.

One focus area of our stewardship activities is pursuing our targets towards achieving net zero, which is part of

our sustainable investment strategy. It is intended to support our contribution to meeting the goals set out in the

Paris Agreement. Another topic we focus on is human rights. Furthermore, we engage with our external asset

managers on their sustainability policies.



4.5.1 Governance and escalation mechanisms



For the assets in scope of this policy, GIM sets the framework for engagement and voting activities. As our

internal asset manager, MEAG performs most of the stewardship activities in close contact with, and with

guidance from, GIM. Third-party asset managers are expected to pursue their own stewardship approach and

have to report on their activities at regular intervals.



The ESG IC approves proposed stewardship targets (e.g. company engagements or proxy voting activities) with

a focus on meeting climate investment goals, sustainability risks, human rights aspects, controversies and

opportunities, as well as general stewardship matters that protect the investment interests of Munich Re Group.

These goals are reviewed on a regular basis. As an escalation mechanism, the ESG IC decides on investment

consequences for specific holdings where stewardship goals are not met. Regarding proxy voting, the ESG IC is

informed on an annual basis and discusses the season’s proxy voting results.

25



4.5.2 Scope



Our stewardship activities focus on engagement with our current and potential investees, or with other issuers

based on a dedicated selection process. Currently, we are focusing on high emission contributors in our liquid

portfolio, as well as selected illiquid assets. Another topic that we are concentrating on for our liquid portfolio is

human rights. Engagements are performed mainly via MEAG’s Center of Competence for Stewardship.



Moreover, we consider proxy voting as a measure to hold investee companies accountable. For equities, MEAG

is instructed in accordance with a specific process to exercise and disclose proxy-voting rights at annual general

meetings on Munich Re Group’s behalf.



4.5.3 Approach



In the engagement dialogue, material topics such as high standards of corporate governance and responsible

management of environmental and social aspects are addressed. Our focus topics include climate considerations

relating to the targets set as part of the climate strategy, as well as our expansion to include human rights by

endorsing the collaborative platform PRI advance.



The strategic engagement framework, jointly developed by GIM and MEAG, includes several steps: First, a

materiality assessment is conducted to select invested companies for an engagement. This involves analysing

invested companies according to selective criteria (e.g. climate materiality KPIs). Our climate strategy places

particular emphasis on the sectors Thermal Coal and Oil \& Gas. For both sectors, a process is in place to engage

with investees to develop a credible transition strategy.

When an investee/issuer is selected, the second step involves developing a detailed engagement roadmap with

time-bound milestones. Monitoring and evaluation complement the process (further described in 4.5.6 Monitoring,

reporting and disclosure).

To qualify as an engagement, contact with the engagement target has to take place at least twice a year and the

engagement has to run for an extended period of time.

Regarding our proxy voting, we place special focus on contributing to Munich Re Group Ambition and hence to

net zero topics.



4.5.4 Engagement



Our Group-internal asset manager MEAG engages with target companies, as we are convinced that positive

change is achieved through constructive dialogue with our investees/issuers. Our engagements - conducted by

MEAG’s Center of Competence for Stewardship - are focused on achieving a lasting improvement in the

management of climate risks and opportunities for investees/issuers. MEAG’s engagement approach is outlined

in the MEAG Engagement Policy7.



7 The MEAG Engagement Policy can be found here: https://www.meag.com/en/esg/esg-governance.html

26



4.5.5 Voting activities



MEAG is required to exercise voting rights for our investments at the annual general meeting on behalf of Munich

Re Group. It is important for us to reflect the success of our engagements when exercising our voting rights. In

cases involving conflicts of interest in relation to proxy voting, we have processes in place. Details regarding our

framework related to voting activities, and the voting results, are made transparent in the MEAG Proxy Voting

Policy8 and the MEAG Participation Policy9.



4.5.6 Monitoring, reporting and disclosure



GIM oversees all engagement and voting activities and monitors their progress by setting a framework for

reporting. For MEAG-led engagements, this is achieved using a dedicated template to track progress which is

discussed and reviewed on a quarterly basis by GIM and MEAG. Furthermore, all asset managers are required

to report their engagement activities to GIM on an annual basis (also ad hoc where necessary). Overall, the

engagement seasons are reviewed and discussed in the ESG IC. Particular focus is placed on companies that

have already been engaged for three years: a detailed discussion is organised if the engagement is achieving

the expected progress in order to decide on its continuation and potential escalation. The proxy voting season is

made transparent by MEAG through their public voting report10.
