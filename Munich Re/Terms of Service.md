Responsible Investment Guideline



Policy of Munich Re Group

Version: 1 December 2024

(Update: 1 August 2025)

2



1 Objective



This Responsible Investment Guideline (RIG) outlines the general framework for Group investment activities,

prescribing responsible standards and requirements that are to be upheld within Munich Re Group in order to

implement sustainability in our investment strategy, considering environmental, social and governance criteria.



As Munich Re is aware of its responsibility and influence as a large asset owner and investor, the integration of

sustainability criteria is a key element of our investment strategy. We use both general sustainability criteria which

are explained in our Sustainability reporting (e.g. climate, biodiversity and human rights) and specific

sustainability criteria tailored to asset classes (e.g. energy efficiency or ESG ratings).



Munich Re was one of the first signatories of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and is committed to

clear GHG-reduction targets. Moreover, Munich Re was part of the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) and

decided to leave the alliance in June 2025. We are convinced that we will be able to pursue our climate targets

in a more focused and targeted manner on our own. Further details on this decision can be found in our public

statement1. In addition to these targets, ESG-focused investments which Munich Re pursues aim to generate a

positive sustainable effect alongside financial returns. In line with its climate strategy, Munich Re specifically aims

to significantly increase its investment exposure in renewable energies over time.



2 Scope of application



2.1 Entities in scope



This Guideline is directly applicable to Munich Reinsurance Company including its branches and representative

offices. All Munich Re (Group) entities2 with licenses for primary insurance or reinsurance and our internal asset

managers (MEAG AMG, Munich Re Investment Partners) will implement the objectives, principles and

requirements as stipulated herein by adopting this Guideline or introducing an equivalent norm, or by other

adequate means. As concerns third party asset managers, we strive to contractually agree the application of this

Guideline or a comparable standard.



Should any provision of this Guideline be contrary to local law, the latter shall always take precedence.



2.2 Assets in scope



The RIG applies to the investment of proprietary assets of Munich Re, irrespective of whether they are managed

by Munich Re itself, by Group Investment Management (GIM), by our internal asset managers (MEAG, Munich

Re Investment Partners) or by a third party.



This Guideline focuses on direct investments in the asset classes of equities, corporates, government and

covered bonds, and in alternative investments, with minor exceptions as detailed below. We aim to extend the

scope of the RIG to encompass all assets wherever possible, depending on various factors such as asset-class

characteristics, industry standards, and the constantly evolving data and analytics environment, and we will

review this on at least a yearly basis.



The RIG does not apply to assets held or derivatives used to manage, cover or hedge reinsurance financial

structures (e.g. hedging platforms), products sold as risk management solutions or finance products for non-

Group clients. For the avoidance of doubt, any assets/derivatives in the International Financial Reporting

2 Entities include affiliated Group companies (subsidiaries) and branches. Affiliated companies of Munich Reinsurance Company include all Munich Re

(Group) companies in which Munich Reinsurance Company (in)directly holds the majority of capital and/or voting rights or which are (in)directly

3



Standards (IFRS) category "Insurance-related Investment" are out of scope of the RIG and are instead subject

to the guidelines applicable to the Munich Re insurance business.



For indirect investment products (fund investments), compliance with RIG requirements, e.g. exclusions, cannot

be ensured by Munich Re, GIM, MEAG or other asset managers assigned with managing Munich Re assets. We

aim to identify these investment products and to apply sustainability processes to them as far as feasible, e.g. by

suggesting model clauses for the integration of biodiversity considerations. In accordance with the Investment

Guideline for Infrastructure Funds, if a specific exclusion is not possible, this has to be made transparent in the

GIM Alternative Investments Investment Committee (GIM AIIC). For private equity and private debt funds, the

asset manager should make best efforts to negotiate the inclusion of the relevant restrictions in the fund and

document the efforts or encourage the fund manager to include our exclusions and restrictions into the

production/portfolio selection process.



For mutual funds/ exchange traded funds, it is not possible to negotiate the inclusion of specific restrictions with

the manager, and transparency on the funds’ contents is limited. Therefore, due care must be taken in the

selection process before buying ETFs and mutual funds. We analyse sustainability criteria such as MSCI ratings

and other available data to ensure a best effort approach in the selection process.



3 Governance



Strategic decisions on sustainability in investments are made by the Board of Management in the ESG Committee

(ESG C), supported by the ESG Management Team (ESG MT). On the investment side, the ESG Investment

Committee (ESG IC) focuses specifically on the implementation of the sustainability strategy in investments. In

addition, the GIM AIIC is focusing particularly on manners related to alternative assets.

As a member of the Board of Management, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) is responsible for the Group's

investment management. The GIM division, which reports to the CIO, is the asset owner function responsible for

the Group's sustainable investment strategy and has set up its own Sustainability in Investments team for this

purpose. Within our investment community, there are dedicated sustainability teams within GIM and our internal

asset managers MEAG and Munich Re Investment Partners.

In order to anchor the topic of sustainability in our investment processes, the Sustainability in Investments team

is supported by ESG multipliers throughout GIM. This structure is also mirrored in asset management at MEAG,

which manages a large proportion of our investments. The targeted implementation of the sustainability strategy

by MEAG is supported by membership of GIM's ESG IC, by the constant exchange of information between the

sustainability teams in the investment area and by the ESG multipliers in the various portfolio management teams.



The GIM Reputational Risk Committee (GIM RRC) supports our efforts to address sustainability risks holistically

by analysing and assessing reputational risks in the investment area. Munich Re understands reputational risk

as a risk of possible damage to Munich Re Group's reputation, which arises as a consequence of a negative

public perception, deteriorated rating or company value, etc. Sensitive issues that could lead to reputational risks

have to be dealt with by adhering to the risk management and compliance processes. The GIM RRC gets involved

if a reputational risk is indicated regarding individual investments as far as Munich Re has the power to direct

individual transactions, or investment-related documents that are negotiated with asset managers. Respective

reputational risk committees have been established for each business segment. These committees, if

approached with a reputation risk case in their area of responsibility, review and decide whether such planned

transactions are appropriate.



The existing processes of the risk management policy/compliance policy and its rules of procedure must be

complied with. This also applies in the event of potential reputational issues.

4 Approach to sustainability



The systematic integration of sustainability criteria into our investment management activities is a fundamental

component of our investment strategy. Our investment strategy comprises four key elements: systematic

integration of sustainability criteria in the investment processes, defined exclusion and restriction criteria, selected

ESG-focused investments such as renewable energy and green bonds, as well as stewardship activities including

engagement and proxy voting. In addition, we require that all our asset managers apply sustainability criteria

when managing our portfolios.



It is our conviction that integrating sustainability criteria into investment decisions contributes to a better, more

holistic risk management of the assets we own. Our belief is that sustainability integration leads to higher risk-

adjusted returns in the long-term. We combine various approaches to the integration of sustainability criteria

across our investment value chain, from the strategic asset allocation to asset management, such as ESG-

focused investing (which e.g. aims to contribute to climate change mitigation, see section 4.4), norm-based

exclusion criteria (e.g. coal or human rights), holistic stewardship practices, and the inclusion of sustainability

criteria in financial analysis. This helps us to identify risks and opportunities beyond standard financial analysis.



Our sustainability teams within GIM and at our internal asset managers work closely with sustainability experts

when integrating sustainability aspects into our investment processes. External data providers supply us with

issuer-specific ESG ratings, KPIs (e.g. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission data), and issuer-specific screening of

business activities and controversies, according to our needs. We use relevant research data in our financial

analysis, to better understand sustainability risks and opportunities, and as input when screening investments

regarding specific sustainability topics as well as exclusion criteria. They also serve as input for screening the

majority of our assets for specific sustainability criteria.



4.1 Integration of sustainability criteria



Sustainability criteria can only be integrated into the investment process if they are made transparent through

corresponding data and analysis. We aim to constantly increase the integration of sustainability criteria by

screening listed assets for issuer ESG ratings and analysing specific sustainability criteria for alternative assets.



As sustainability plays an important role for Munich Re Group, sustainability criteria are part of the M\&A process

when considering investments in new strategic participations, within the strategic fit assessment and, when

deemed relevant, in the due diligence.



The following themes are especially important to us when integrating sustainability aspects into our investment

decisions:



Biodiversity

The urgency to address biodiversity loss and its implications for asset owners cannot be overstated. The

escalating concern over the extent of biodiversity loss has led to a heightened focus on this issue in sustainability

discussions at the corporate level. As companies face increasing scrutiny and pressure to disclose their

environmental risks, asset owners also recognise the relevance of biodiversity in their investment decisions.



Controversial weapons

Weapon-related business is a sensitive international topic. Munich Re Group adopts a prudent approach and

carefully assesses potential impacts that such business might have on our reputation. The Group has committed

itself not to support businesses that do not fully comply with international conventions. Hence, we exclude

5



investments in issuers involved in weapon categories that are considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiable

suffering to combatants or to affect civilians indiscriminately and that are deemed inhumane by international

conventions.



Food-related transactions

Munich Re sees investments in food-related commodities critically from a sustainability perspective, as they may

cause social imbalances.



Human rights

With its Declaration of Principles on the Respect and Protection of Human Rights, Munich Re has expressed the

importance of human rights and the high priority they have for the entire Group. This means that we underpin our

understanding of responsibility for human rights by recognising international guidelines and standards.



Oil \& Gas

The Oil and Gas sector faces an increasing need to understand the implications of the energy transition for its

operations and business models, and to explain the contributions it can make to reducing GHG emissions and

achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Our dedicated emission reduction targets are elaborated in the next

chapter.



Oil sands

The detrimental effects of extracting oil from oil sands (also known as tar sands) can be significant for the

environment and local communities. Among other things, extracting oil from oil sands consumes more energy

and resources than the extraction and refining of conventional oil, and it is among the most carbon-intensive

methods of crude oil production. Our dedicated emission reduction targets are elaborated in the next chapter.



Thermal Coal

Since power generated by thermal coal is responsible for two-thirds of the emissions that come from the energy

sector globally, we see reducing thermal coal as a major accelerator for reaching net zero. The firing of thermal

coal for energy is the single largest contributor to man-made global temperature increase (see "Position Paper:

Thermal Coal" by the NZAOA3). Our dedicated emission reduction targets are elaborated in the next chapter.



4.2 GHG reduction targets



In December 2020, as part of our Munich Re Group Ambition 2025, Munich Re set clear decarbonisation targets

for the direct asset classes listed equities, corporate bonds and real estate, based on the target setting framework

of the NZAOA. As an intermediate step, we aim to reduce net GHG emissions for these asset classes in the

Group’s investment portfolio by 25% to 29% by 2025 (compared to the 2019 base year), in order to achieve net

zero emissions by 2050. We have also set specific reduction targets for 2025 for direct listed equities and

corporate bonds in the Oil \& Gas (- 25%) and thermal coal (- 35%) sectors, and to fully exit investments in thermal

coal by 2040. We assess this at Group level, i.e. individual legal entities can exceed or fall short of the target as

long as the overall target is reached across the Group as a whole. All GHG emissions are measured in CO2-

equivalent (CO2e).

4.3 Exclusions and restrictions



We define exclusions from and restrictions on the investment universe to avoid undesirable activities that do not

fit our sustainability strategy. We implement our exclusions on issuers for which we detect a unique identifier that

is suitable for implementation at our asset managers. For indirect investment products, compliance with RIG

requirements, e.g. exclusions, cannot be ensured. We aim to identify these investment products and to apply

sustainability processes to them as far as feasible, e.g. by suggesting model clauses for the integration of

biodiversity considerations.



4.3.1 Regarding liquid assets



Exclusions are implemented using the centrally managed "listed issuer exclusion lists"4 based on our negative

screening process and criteria, which are binding for all of our asset managers. GIM Sustainability in Investments

reviews the lists of excluded issuers on a quarterly basis to the best of their knowledge regarding the screened

issuers. Exclusions and restrictions are applicable to either listed equities, corporate bonds, commodities, and

sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and government agencies or several of those asset classes as described below.



4.3.1.1 Listed equity and corporate bonds



4.3.1.1.1 Controversial weapons Exclusion



Munich Re rules out direct investments in equities or bonds of issuers5 verifiably involved in controversial

weapons and key components through their own operations, through a subsidiary (majority ownership /

controlling shareholder), through a joint venture (regardless of ownership stake) or as a bond issuer issuing debt

for a company that is verifiably involved in controversial weapons. This refers to companies which are verifiably

involved in the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, or transfer of controversial weapons,

as well as assistance in any of these activities. We define controversial weapons according to the following

weapon categories:

• Anti-personnel mines

• Cluster munitions

• Biological weapons

• Chemical weapons

• Blinding laser weapons

• Incendiary weapons (excluding white phosphorus weapons)

• Non-detectable fragments



4 We implement our exclusions on issuers for which we detect a unique identifier that is suitable for implementation at our asset managers.

5 We implement our exclusions on issuers for which we detect a unique identifier that is suitable for implementation at our asset managers.

4.3.1.1.2 Human rights Exclusion



In order to integrate human rights considerations into our investment decisions, we conduct a Group-wide risk

analysis: A norm-based screening based on external data is assessed and internally validated.

This due diligence process, steered by the Group Sustainability Department (Munich Re Group Human Rights

Officer), involves a scoring methodology consisting of the principles of the UN Global Compact and a customized

Human Rights Violator Index. The index consists of various human rights-related factors such as human

trafficking and forced labour. As a preventive measure, direct investments in equities and bonds issued by

identified companies showing confirmed significant human rights violations are not permitted. The methodology

for identifying such companies is being continuously evolved. GIM monitors the portfolio regularly and evaluates

remediation measures in the case of an ad-hoc event.



Figure 2: Decision tree for human rights for companies (liquid assets)

8



4.3.1.1.3 Oil \& Gas Exclusion



We screen companies in the Oil \& Gas sector and analyse the intensity and development of their GHG emissions.

For the sector target, we use the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sub-Industries. For the purpose

of calculating our GHG footprint, we define relevant Oil and Gas sectors as Oil \& Gas Exploration \& Production,

Oil \& Gas Refining \& Marketing, Oil \& Gas Drilling and Integrated Oil \& Gas.

In order to further facilitate the achievement of the Paris Climate Agreement’s targets, we cease to make new

direct investments in pure-play Oil \& Gas companies as of 1 April 2023. We define pure-play Oil \& Gas companies

as listed companies within the GICS Oil \& Gas Subindustries except Integrated Oil \& Gas.



As of 1 January 2025, for new investments, we will require a credible commitment from listed Integrated Oil \&

Gas companies to net zero GHG emissions by 2050 including corresponding short- and mid-term milestones.

These companies are selected and assessed based on data provided by Institutional Shareholder Service (ISS)

ESG, a recognized provider of sustainability-related data analysis. If, in an exceptional case, this data is regarded

as outdated or incomplete, Integrated Oil \& Gas companies may be subject to a comprehensive assessment by

internal research analysts using additional data sources, which may result in the exclusion or inclusion of the

respective company.



Exceptions apply for green bonds and engagement under specific conditions:

We may selectively invest in green bonds issued by Oil \& Gas companies which are compliant with an accredited

green bond framework (such as the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles or

the EU Green Bond Standard), which have been assessed by an external review provider and where the issuer

has a public commitment to a 2050 net zero target (or Paris-aligned pathway). Under specific conditions, GIM

Sustainability in Investments may decide to engage with companies in line with the approach outlined in section

4.5 rather than ceasing to invest.

9



Figure 3: Decision tree for Oil \& Gas (liquid assets)



4.3.1.1.4 Oil sands Exclusion



Munich Re does not directly invest in equities or bonds of companies that derive more than 10% of their revenues

from oil sands extraction. We may selectively invest in green bonds issued by oil sands companies which are

compliant with an accredited green bond framework (such as the International Capital Market Association (ICMA)

Green Bond Principles or the EU Green Bond Standard), which have been assessed by an external review

provider and where the issuer has a public commitment to a 2050 net zero target (or Paris-aligned pathway).

10



Figure 4: Decision tree for oil sands (liquid assets)



4.3.1.1.5 Thermal coal Exclusion



For thermal coal, we apply two types of exclusions:

One, relative exclusion criteria where we rule out direct investments in listed equities or corporate bonds of

companies that:

• derive more than 15% of their revenues from thermal coal mining and/or the generation of electricity from

thermal coal firing.

Two, absolute exclusion criteria where we rule out direct investments in listed equities or corporate bonds of

companies that:

• have an annual thermal coal production above 10 Mt, or

• have an installed coal-fired generation capacity above 5 GW.

• Companies, affected by absolute exclusion criteria regarding coal production and installed capacity, that have

a credible commitment to net zero GHG emissions by 2050, including corresponding short- and mid-term

milestones, are exempted. These companies are selected and assessed based on data provided by ISS

ESG. If, in an exceptional case, this data is regarded as outdated or incomplete, absolute thermal coal

exclusions may be subject to a comprehensive assessment by internal research analysts using additional

data sources, which may result in the exclusion or inclusion of the respective company.

For both types of exclusions, an exception for green bonds and engagement applies und specific conditions:

In order to support the transition to a low carbon economy and to finance the transition of the issuer, green bonds

issued by affected companies remain investable under specific conditions: The issuer must publicly commit to a

2050 net zero target (or Paris-aligned pathway) and to a thermal coal exit by 2040 at the latest. Moreover, the

green bond must be compliant with an accredited Green Bond Framework (such as ICMA Green Bond Principles

or EU Green Bond Standard) and assessed by an external review provider.

11



In selected cases (companies meeting absolute KPI exclusions and companies with relative revenue thresholds

between 15 % and 30%), GIM Sustainability in Investments may decide to engage with companies in line with

the approach outlined in section 4.5 rather than ceasing to invest.



Checklist for green bond exceptions

Public commitment by the issuer to a 2050 net zero target (or Paris-aligned pathway) and

Public commitment to a thermal coal exit by 2040 at the latest, and

Compliance with an accredited Green Bond Framework (e.g. ICMA Green Bond Principles, EU Green

Bond Standard) and assessment by external review provider.



Figure 5: Decision tree for thermal coal (liquid assets)



4.3.1.2 Bonds from sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and government agencies



4.3.1.2.1 ESG country rating Exclusion



Direct investments in sovereigns, sub-sovereigns, and government agencies of countries rated "CCC" by MSCI

(ESG rating scale AAA-CCC) are not permitted.



4.3.1.2.2 Human Rights Exclusion



For sovereign, sub-sovereign and government agency risk analysis, we apply a specific human rights country

score based on an external data provider taking into account factors such as modern slavery, forced labour, and

child labour.

We monitor our portfolio accordingly and exclude countries with extreme risks. GIM regularly monitors the

exposure to countries with high risk. The methodology regarding the human rights country rating is being

continuously evolved.

12



If there is an indication of increased reputational risk for countries that have not yet been sanctioned, the Board

of Management may decide to exclude them.



Figure 6: Decision tree for bonds from sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and government agencies (liquid assets)



4.3.1.3 Commodities



4.3.1.3.1 Food-related transactions Exclusion



We do not trade or hold investments in food-related commodities (e.g. grains and oilseeds, livestock, dairy, etc.)

or related derivatives. This prohibition does not apply to the farming and/or leasing of farmland or forest including

typical and usual risk management instruments in the agricultural and forestry industries (e.g. forward sales,

currency hedging, variety licenses).



Checklist food-related commodities

No trading or holding of investments in food-related commodities (e.g. grains and oilseeds, livestock, dairy,

etc.) or related derivatives

Exceptions for farming and/or leasing of farmland or forest

4.3.2 Regarding alternative assets



We integrate sustainability criteria in the investment processes of alternative asset classes as described below

and we continuously aspire to provide "best effort" sustainability processes as far as feasible. In the field of

alternative assets, we have defined ESG-focused investments that aim to contribute to e.g. climate change

mitigation (see section 4.4).



When making direct alternative investments, we assess new investments within the due diligence process using

sustainability criteria. The sustainability assessment is also part of the risk management second opinion compiled

by our internal asset manager MEAG. For indirect investment products, compliance with RIG requirements, e.g.

exclusions, cannot be ensured. We aim to identify these investment products and to apply sustainability

processes to them as far as feasible.



For the following alternative assets, we apply certain exclusions or require certain standards (restrictions) as

listed per sub-asset class below.



4.3.2.1 Infrastructure investments



4.3.2.1.1 Biodiversity Exclusion



We are conducting a review of alternative investments, except private equity and private debt funds, using the

Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) as part of the due diligence process. IBAT provides commercial

users with spatial data on biodiversity globally from several key datasets, such as natural and mixed UN World

Heritage Sites (as defined by the UNESCO World Heritage Convention).



We do not conduct direct alternative majority investments via our internal asset managers in critical industries6,

if a material portion of the underlying assets are situated in a natural or mixed World Heritage Site. In ambiguous

cases (e.g. regarding materiality or a project in non-critical industries), the GIM AIIC is informed and may involve

the GIM RRC.



6 Mining \& metals, oil \& gas (esp. upstream), coal operations, engineering and construction services / electric utilities and power generators (utilities

incl. hydropower), construction materials, agricultural products / meat poultry and dairy, forestry management, chemicals, biofuels, marine ports and

services

14



For indirect alternative investments (fund investments) and for investments via non-Group asset managers,

Munich Re has limited transparency and influence regarding the above restrictions. In such cases, we engage

the counterparty and aim to include the restrictions in the fund documentation (e.g. side letter) as far as feasible.

If this is not possible, Munich Re may still choose to invest if the counterparty provides solid reasons in writing

on why the exclusion is not possible, its policy on biodiversity, or explanations on their general approach to

biodiversity that meet our standards.

4.3.2.1.2 Controversial weapons Exclusion



With regard to alternative investments, we do not invest in any infrastructure assets that are verifiably involved in

the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention or transfer of controversial weapons according to

our definition7.



7 Controversial weapons categories are defined as anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, biological weapons, chemical weapons, blinding laser

weapons, incendiary weapons (excl. white phosphorus weapons), and non-detectable fragments.

15



Figure 9: Decision tree for controversial weapons (alternative assets)



4.3.2.1.3 Human rights



When making new direct infrastructure investments through our internal asset managers, we consider a list of

human rights-specific requirements in the due diligence process. Any significant controversial indicators of human

rights violations are reported to the GIM AIIC prior to taking an investment decision. The GIM AIIC may involve

the GIM RRC.



For indirect alternative investments (fund investments) and for investments via non-Group asset managers,

Munich Re has limited transparency and influence regarding the above restrictions. In such cases, we engage

the counterparty and aim to include the restrictions in the fund documentation (e.g. side letter) as far as feasible.

If this is not possible, Munich Re may still choose to invest if the counterparty provides solid reasons in writing

on why the exclusion is not possible, its policy on human rights, or explanations on their general approach to

human rights that meet our standards.

4.3.2.2 Forestry \& agriculture investments



4.3.2.2.1 Certifications



Sustainability considerations are comprehensively integrated into the investment process. Environmental, climate

change, and biodiversity aspects, as well as human rights and workforce safety issues, are among the major

topics considered.



For forestry investments, we focus on the asset managers / property managers and analyse their respective

certifications, placing specific demands on them: Munich Re stipulates that asset managers / property managers

must ensure that the management of all certifiable forestry investments is certified by Forest Stewardship Council

(FSC), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), or equivalently within 5 years of

acquisition. Forestry investments that will not meet this requirement are not allowed.

4.3.2.2.2 Sustainability specifics in the due diligence process Restriction



For each new direct forestry \& agriculture investment made by the internal asset manager, detailed “ESG Criteria

Evaluation for Forestry Investments” and “ESG Criteria Evaluation for Agricultural Investments” questionnaires

are applied, shedding light on sustainability aspects, including biodiversity and human rights. Moreover, the

Munich Re internal assessment framework is applied that covers physical climate risks. When taking the

investment decision, the internal asset manager presents key findings from the ESG checklist to the GIM AIIC.

For investments made by the internal asset manager MEAG, the MEAG ESG and Sustainable Finance team is

involved in the due diligence process.

External Real Estate Investments



Specific requirements for third party asset managers Restriction



For third party asset managers, we focus on managers who have fully integrated sustainability considerations

across the investment lifecycle. Real estate specific sustainability roles and responsibilities are a must.

Investment strategies have to comply with a set of minimum sustainability criteria (e.g. Green Building

certification). An ESG rating like Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) is an advantage.



Real Estate Debt (Mortgages)



Sustainability specifics in the lending policy Restriction



The sustainability approach in Real Estate Debt is currently expanded from sustainability exclusion criteria to

sustainability selection criteria.

However, being a debt lender implies no direct access to the underlying real estate assets which is why a

profound sustainability assessment depends on the data quality provided by the investor / owner of the building.

Please see the listed measures and implementations in the key topic areas.

4.3.3 Third party asset managers



4.3.3.1 Selection process



Munich Re only works with asset managers with dedicated sustainability capabilities, and only selects asset

managers who are UN PRI signatories or in the process of becoming one. Exceptions are decided on by GIM

RRC.



Figure 14: Decision tree for third party asset manager selection



A Request for Proposal must be filled out by potential asset managers, outlining their sustainability capabilities,

strategy and research approach. It also covers the individual approach regarding engagements, as well as GHG

footprint measurement, decarbonisation, biodiversity, and human rights within the investment process. GHG

emission reporting capabilities are required for markets / asset classes where relevant data is available, with

sufficient quality. The evaluation of the questionnaire is followed by a detailed dialogue with the asset managers

to further evaluate their sustainability efforts. The selection process continues with scoring of the asset managers,

including a dedicated section for sustainability considerations. According to this, the best fitting asset manager is

selected and the onboarding process starts.



4.3.3.2 Target setting and monitoring



For mandates in a liquid asset class, we aim to assign a decarbonisation target for 2025. If the target is not met,

intensified discussions will be initiated with the asset manager.

The asset managers are monitored on a regular basis where ESG integration, sustainability policies, and

engagement topics are reviewed. This is done via annual reporting and review meetings by the Asset Manager

Selection Team and the GIM Sustainability in Investments Team.



4.3.3.3 Compliance and escalation



In liquid mandates, non-Group managers need to comply with the Munich Re exclusion list in the asset classes

fixed income and equities. The exclusions are then coded into the asset manager’s limit system where potential

violations will be blocked. If an excluded name is traded, it will result in an active breach of the Investment

Guideline. Respective escalation mechanisms are described in the chapter on implementation, monitoring and

escalation of this Guideline.



For illiquid mandates, in the contractual negotiations with external asset managers, we aim to include a reference

to the Munich Re exclusion list. It is the explicit obligation of the Asset Manager to ensure strict adherence to

contractual agreements. In the event of non-compliance, the Asset Manager shall take immediate corrective

action to remedy the situation and notify GIM. Failure to do so will result in the mandate being categorically

23



downgraded to "red" status, as reflected in GIM's quarterly internal reviews, and a formal alert will be issued to

AIIC via a red light note. The next steps will be agreed and implemented jointly.



4.4 ESG-focused investments



We call thematic investments that aim to positively contribute to our sustainable investment strategy, ESG-

focused investments. Currently, these are renewable energy investments, certified real estate investments,

forests with certified management and green bonds. In the medium-term, we aim to extend the range of these

ESG-focused investments amongst others to accord with regulatory developments, specifically with regard to the

classification of investments according to the EU taxonomy.



4.4.1 Renewable energy investments



We seek to invest in renewable energy investments to promote the energy transition. We define renewable

energy investments as investments into energy production facilities and related infrastructure (e.g. including

power, heat, fuel production, storage and grids) based on renewable energy sources (e.g. including solar, wind,

geothermal and hydro energy). In line with our ambition until 2025, we have increased our investments in

renewable energy to over €3 billion.



4.4.2 Certified real estate investments



We define certified real estate investments as those which are certified by "EU Green Building", "Building

Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)", "Leadership in Energy and

Environmental Design (LEED)", "Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen (DGNB)" or that have other

equivalent certifications.



New direct real estate investments must obtain an ecolabel or a recognised level of certification. If an investment

property is not certified, the asset manager must determine the measures required for certification and factor the

costs of these measures into the cash flow base case to initiate a certification process..



It is also necessary to ensure sustainability compatibility of optimisations/revitalisations of existing properties.

Measures to achieve the mentioned certifications are highly recommended in order to improve the sustainability

of the existing portfolio.



4.4.3 Certified forest management



We define sustainable forest investments, if the management has an existing certification by FSC, PEFC or an

equivalent certification. The asset manager assesses each investment individually using sustainability criteria

during the due diligence.



Sustainability criteria should be promoted and integrated into the ongoing management activities. Independent

reviews of applied management practices from FSC, PEFC or equivalent certifiers are of utmost importance, as

they verify ongoing sustainable forest management activities.



4.4.4 Green bonds



We understand green bonds as bonds that are linked to investments like renewable energies, sustainable waste

management, biodiversity conservation or sustainable land use according to our data provider. This classification

is based on the issuing documents, stock exchange announcements or information from parties involved in the

24



issue (e.g. lead managers). Moreover, green bonds we report on, have to be compliant with an accredited green

bond framework (such as the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles or the EU

Green Bond Standard) and assessed by an external review provider.



We will continuously refine this approach taking into account the changing regulatory environment. As outlined

under the restrictions regarding thermal coal, oil sands and Oil \& Gas above, we may invest in green bonds of

companies on our exclusion lists under specific exemptions.



4.5 Stewardship approach



Munich Re engages (mainly via asset managers and in some specific cases also directly) with investees/issuers

to promote high sustainability standards. Stewardship aspects, we focus on, include:

• engaging with investees/issuers, and with our asset managers (please also refer to section 4.3.3),

• holding them to account on defined material issues, and

• exercising voting rights and responsibilities.

One focus area of our stewardship activities is pursuing our goals towards achieving net zero which is part of our

sustainable investment strategy. It has the potential to contribute to the Paris Agreement targets. Furthermore,

we also engage our external asset managers on their sustainability policies.



4.5.1 Governance and escalation mechanisms



For the assets in scope of this policy, GIM sets the framework for engagement and voting activities. As our internal

asset manager, MEAG fulfils most of the stewardship activities in close contact and guidance with GIM. Third

party asset managers are expected to carry out their own stewardship approach and regularly have to report on

their activities.



The ESG IC approves proposed stewardship targets (e.g. company engagements or proxy voting activities) with

a focus on meeting climate investment goals, sustainability risks, controversies and opportunities, as well as

general stewardship matters that protect the investment interests of Munich Re. These goals are reviewed on a

regular basis. As an escalation mechanism, the ESG IC decides on investment consequences for specific

holdings where stewardship goals are not met. Regarding proxy voting, the ESG IC is informed on an annual

basis and discusses the proxy voting results of the season.



4.5.2 Scope



Our stewardship activities focus on engagement with our current and potential investees, or with other issuers

according to a dedicated selection process. Currently, we are focusing on top polluting companies of our listed

equity and corporate bonds portfolio. Engagements are performed mainly via MEAG’s Center of Competence for

Stewardship.



For equities, MEAG is instructed in accordance with a specific process to exercise and disclose proxy-voting

rights at the annual general meeting on behalf of Munich Re. Proxy voting is also considered as a measure to

hold investee companies accountable.

25



4.5.3 Approach



In the engagement dialogue, material topics, such as high standards of corporate governance, and responsible

management of environmental and social aspects, are addressed. Our focus topics include climate

considerations relating to the targets set within the climate strategy, as well as our expansion to human rights by

endorsing the collaborative platform PRI advance.



GIM analyses invested companies according to selective criteria, such as GHG footprint, investment value, as

well as sectors. Engagements are chosen in relation to material financed GHG emissions, climate strategy and

issuer goals. Our climate strategy places special focus on the sectors thermal coal and Oil \& Gas. For both

sectors, a process is in place to engage investees for an emission reduction. To qualify for an engagement,

specific requirements are considered: The issuer must publicly commit to a 2050 net zero target (or Paris-aligned

pathway). For coal companies the issuer must additionally commit to a thermal coal exit by 2040 at the latest.

Regarding our proxy voting recommendation, we pay a special focus to contributing to the Group Ambition and

hence to net zero topics.



4.5.4 Engagement



Our Group-internal asset manager MEAG engages target companies, as we are convinced that positive change

is achieved through a constructive dialogue with our investees/issuers. Our engagements - conducted by MEAG’s

Center of Competence for Stewardship - are focused on a lasting improvement of the management of climate

risks and opportunities of investees/issuer. MEAG’s engagement approach is outlined in the MEAG Engagement

Policy10.



4.5.5 Voting activities



MEAG is required to exercise voting rights for our investments at the annual general meeting on behalf of Munich

Re. It is important to us to reflect the engagement success when exercising our voting rights. In case of conflict

of interest in relation to proxy voting, we have processes in place. Details regarding our framework related to

voting activities, and the voting results, are made transparent in the MEAG Proxy Voting Policy11 and the MEAG

Participation Policy12.

4.5.6 Monitoring, reporting and disclosure



GIM oversees all engagement and voting activities and monitors their progress by setting a framework for

reporting. For MEAG-conducted engagements, this is achieved via a dedicated template to track progress which

is discussed and reviewed on a quarterly basis by GIM and MEAG. Furthermore, all asset managers are required

to report their engagement activities to GIM on an annual basis (also ad hoc where necessary). Overall, the

engagement seasons are reviewed and discussed in the ESG IC. A special focus is placed on companies that

have been engaged for 3 years already: a detailed discussion is taking place if the engagement is achieving the

expected progress in order to decide on its continuation and potential escalation. The proxy voting season is

made transparent by MEAG through their public voting report13.
