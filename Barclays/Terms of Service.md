Introduction

Our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, approved by shareholders in 2020, was driven by a

recognition of the risks and opportunities associated with climate change.



We continue to enhance how we manage the risks associated with the transition, financial and

associated, and evolve how we appropriately mitigate these risks through our policies and processes,

including our environmental statements such as this, taking into account regional and jurisdictional

considerations. We will continue to consider and adapt our approach in light of the evolving landscape.

Scope of statement

This statement covers the provision of financing in certain sensitive sectors .



Words in italics are defined in the Key Definitions table and clarify the intended scope of this statement.

Approach to Sustainability Enhanced Due Diligence

We conduct Sustainability Enhanced Due Diligence (SEDD) on a case-by-case basis on Groups in scope of

this statement. This approach is risk based and Groups are analysed against specific environmental and

social risk considerations in addition to the below requirements which include, but are not limited to:

i. The Group’s adherence to the Equator Principles (if a project finance or credit transaction is

deemed to be in scope) including, where appropriate, any relevant International Finance

Corporation (IFC) performance standards;

ii. The Group’s adherence to local and national environmental regulation and standards and Industry

best practice;

iii. The Group’s management and implementation of procedures which minimise direct

environmental impacts in the context of their operations;

iv. The Group’s disclosures in relation to corporate governance and oversight of climate change

issues and associated corporate risks, including disclosure against principles such as the Financial

Stability Board (FSB) Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and appropriate

transition plans;

v. The Group’s approach to and track record in protecting the health and safety of the workforce and

local communities;

vi. The Group’s approach to stakeholder engagement and consultation, including its commitment

and adherence to the principles of Free Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) where indigenous peoples

may be impacted by their operations;

vii. The Group’s approach to identifying and addressing its human rights impacts, including through

due diligence.



Additional SEDD questions will vary by sector, for instance, in addition to the SEDD criteria outlined

above, for Biomass, this process will also consider the sustainable sourcing of feedstock.



External technical input may be obtained to assist the business in reviewing and assessing whether

certain Group activities meet our internal SEDD criteria, or where there is uncertainty as to whether a

certain activity is within scope of our SEDD criteria. Barclays will continue to align its approach to

sensitive sectors with developments in government and public policy.



In order to assist and enhance the SEDD process, we operate a mandatory training programme for

relevant colleagues.

Oil \& Gas

Upstream Oil \& Gas



Working with our clients on their transition

Client Transition Framework (CTF)

We assess the information available on Energy Groups’ plans for alignment with our emissions reduction

targets through the Client Transition Framework (CTF) against several factors including, but not limited to,

the following:

• Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets, including methane.

• Scope 3 absolute emissions reduction targets/ commitments.

• Plans to expand production.

• Low carbon business model activities and plans.



Client Transition Review Forum (CTRF)

We have established a Client Transition Review Forum (CTRF) to carry out targeted reviews of Groups

subject to a CTF assessment. These are informed by the CTF assessment and take into account

consideration of relevant risks and other business factors. These reviews help determine our financing

appetite (including consideration of client retention and conditions to refinancings) alongside implications

for our emissions reduction targets and commercial, credit and reputational impacts.



Energy Groups meeting any of the following will be subject to mandatory annual review by the CTRF to

determine whether continued financing support is appropriate in the context of their investment plans

and overall decarbonisation or transition plans:

• Energy Groups where more than 10% of their total planned upstream oil \& gas capital expenditure

is in expansion.

• Non-diversified Groups

o We recognise that Non-diversified Groups may present greater transition risk than diversified

Energy Groups, in particular those engaged in long-lead expansion.

o We have very limited appetite for Non-diversified Groups where they are engaged in long-lead

expansion.

• Energy Groups with the lowest CTF assessment scores.



Notwithstanding the outcomes of the CTRF reviews, financing decisions are transaction specific and will

continue to be subject to consideration by relevant committees, if appropriate, to consider issues such as

credit risk, reputational risk and capital impact.



Project Level

• We will not provide project finance for expansion projects or infrastructure projects primarily to

be used for such expansion projects.

• We will not provide other direct financing to Energy Groups for expansion projects or

infrastructure projects primarily to be used for such expansion projects.



Entity Level

• We will not provide financing to new clients that are Energy Groups where more than 10% of their

total planned oil \& gas capital expenditure is in expansion.

• We will only provide new financing or renewal of existing financing for Non-diversified Groups

where more than 10% of their total planned oil \& gas capital expenditure is in long-lead expansion,

by exception.

• We expect all Energy Groups to be producing relevant information in relation to their transition

plans or decarbonisation strategies.

5



• We expect Energy Groups to demonstrate that they are committed to reducing their own

emissions by having:

- net zero-aligned near-term Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets (absolute or

intensity-based); and

- targets to reduce methane emissions by 2030, aligned with OGCI, OGMP2.0, or similar

industry guidance; and

- a commitment to end all routine / non-essential venting and flaring by 2030.

Applicability of financing restrictions

Any existing commitments or financing entered into prior to any of the restrictions coming into effect

under the Upstream Oil \& Gas and Unconventional Oil \& Gas sections of this statement may remain in

place (but refinancings of any such commitments or financing shall be subject to the restrictions

described above).



In certain cases, we may enter into Sustainable Finance or Transition Finance transactions with an entity in

a Group that would otherwise be restricted as a result of the application of the Upstream Oil \& Gas

section of this statement where Barclays is satisfied that any Sustainable Finance or Transition Finance

transactions provided to it will not be used directly to support oil \& gas activity.

8



In cases where clients are identified as not meeting the non-mandatory expectations and Barclays has an

active relationship with those clients, we encourage them to adhere to these expectations. Where

clients are unable or unwilling to do so over time, we will review the relationship and may reduce our

support.



Disclosures

We intend to disclose in our annual reporting, subject to maintaining client confidentiality, the following:

• In relation to the CTF assessments in the Energy Sector, the CTF analysis of outcomes by lending

limits, for the relevant financial year.

• The combined number and aggregate value of exceptions granted for the relevant financial year

to:

o Non-diversified Groups under the “Non-diversified Groups restrictions” above (for financial

years starting on or after 1 January 2025).



Referral and Escalation Procedure

We assess the risk of client relationships, and associated transactions, through SEDD and CTRF, and

escalate to the relevant business review committee, where appropriate, for consideration and a decision

on whether to proceed if transaction related.



Should the issues be assessed as presenting material reputational risk, they would be escalated to the

Group Reputation Risk Committee, which comprises members of the Group Executive Committee.



Governance

Any review of this statement will be undertaken by the Barclays Group Sustainability Committee with

escalation to the Barclays Board Sustainability Committee or Barclays Board (as appropriate).



Third Party Data

To the extent this statement requires the assessment of a client or Group’s activities, production

information, revenue, or other financial information including but not limited to information in relation to

clients’ transition or decarbonisation plans, we rely primarily on publicly available information or

information provided by third party data providers (including aggregators of public data). We note,

however, that such data/information can be challenging to obtain, verify and assess. Where data is not

available or is not of a reliably high quality, this may impact our ability to apply restrictions and other

provisions set out in this statement. Barclays shall have no liability for any errors or omissions in

connection with any third-party data which it relies on and considers to be credible.

Arctic Circle Refers to the area within the Arctic Circle, which is subject to sea

ice, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and Coastal Plains.



Biomass

Refers to energy production from biomass and biogas power

plants, which includes the thermal combustion of organic energy

sources, including energy crops and woody biomass.



Captives



In relation to Thermal Coal Power, captives refers to thermal coal -

fired power plants used and managed with the primary purpose of

providing power to an industrial or commercial energy user, for

their own use.

In relation to Thermal Coal Mining, captives refers to thermal coal

mines dedicated to providing thermal coal for captive thermal coal-

fired power plants.



Client Transition Framework

(CTF)



Refers to a tool developed by Barclays designed to support our

evaluation of our corporate clients' current and expected future

progress as they transition to a low-carbon business model.



Client(s)



Means in relation to any proposed transaction the client entity (or

entities) entering into the transaction.

Any restrictions relating to the % revenue generated by such

clients from thermal coal activities applies to the consolidated

revenues of the entity being financed, whether transacting with a

Group parent, subsidiary or joint venture.



Directly finance or direct

financing

Refers to financing where the use of proceeds is known to be for a

particular project.

10



Energy Group(s)

Groups that have over 20% revenue from upstream oil \& gas

activities (i.e. exploration, development and production) and/or

Groups that are considered to be supermajor or major integrated oil

\& gas companies.



Engaged in



In relation to Thermal Coal Mining and Thermal Coal Power, a client

is defined as “engaged in” if it generates more than 5% of its

revenues from thermal coal-fired power generation and/or thermal-

coal mining.

In relation to Amazon Oil \& Gas, a client is defined as “engaged in” if

more than 5% of its expenditure (CAPEX and OPEX) are on oil \& gas

projects in the Amazon Biome.



Expansion

Refers to any upstream oil \& gas projects with a final investment

decision (or equivalent) after 31 December 2021. This includes, but

is not limited to, exploration, development, and production.



Extra Heavy Oil Refers to Crude Oil with an API gravity of less than 15O.



Finance or financing



Refers to all primary financing activity through lending (including

reserve-based lending agreements), underwriting, arranging and/or

distribution of debt or equity, as well as trade and working capital

finance and excludes, without limitation, any debt or securities

traded or placed through secondary market activity.



Barclays may occasionally continue to be involved in primary

financing activity for distressed entities such as (without limitation)

debt for equity swaps and other recapitalisation activities. When

undertaking such activity, Barclays has a responsibility to minimise

losses and will look to deploy possible financing options to manage

distressed positions and/or maximise recoveries where it is a

liability holder. Such financing arrangements are not typically for

the purposes of funding the ongoing operational activity of the

distressed entity. Accordingly, any such activity is excluded from

the definition of financing.



Group(s) In relation to any entity, the relevant parent company and its

consolidated subsidiaries, as a whole.



Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking)

Refers to an oil \& gas well development technique, using a high-

pressure injection of liquid into the rock, which creates fracturing

and allows natural gas and oil to flow more freely.

11



Long-lead expansion



Refers to long-lead time upstream oil \& gas projects with a final

investment decision (or equivalent) after 31 December 2021. The

includes, but is not limited to, exploration, development, and

production1.



Material expansion



In relation to Thermal Coal Mining, refers to an increase in annual

tonnage of thermal coal extracted from existing thermal coal mines,

including captives, by more than 20%, measured from a baseline of

maximum p.a. tonnage for preceding 3 years reported.

In relation to Thermal Coal Power, production refers to an

investment to (i) extend the unabated operating lifetime of existing

thermal coal power plants including captives or (ii) increase net

operational thermal power capacity, including captives, by more

than 10% measure from a baseline of maximum capacity for

preceding 3 years reported.

Material expansion in such cases relates to absolute global

increases rather than increases for an entity or Group as a result of

mergers or acquisitions.



Materially engaged in – Arctic

Circle



For Arctic Circle, Groups are defined as “materially engaged in” if

they have over 20% revenue from oil \& gas activities in the Arctic

Circle or have, after February 2024, approved capital investment for

new exploration and production or new pipeline transportation of

oil \& gas within the Arctic Circle.



Materially engaged in – Fracking

For Hydraulic Fracturing, Groups are defined as “materially engaged

in” if they have over 20% revenue from Fracking activities in the UK

and Europe.



Mountain Top Removal (MTR)

coal mining



Refers to surface coal mining (and the associated reclamation

operations) that remove entire coal seams running through the

upper fraction of a mountain, ridge, or hill, by removing all of the

overburden and creating a level plateau or gently rolling contour

with no high-walls remaining – as defined by the Surface Mining

Control \& Reclamation Act (SMCRA 1977), available at

www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title30-vol3/pdf/CFR-2012-

title30-vol3- sec716-3.pdf



Near-term 2030 or such other near-term target as approved by exception by

Barclays Group Sustainability Committee.



New client(s) Refers to an entity in relation to whom no member of the Group is

an existing client of Barclays.



1 This definition is informed by the IEA Net Zero Roadmap, 2023 update which highlights that the decline in

fossil fuel demand in the IEA NZE Scenario means that no new long-lead time oil \& gas projects are approved

for development. It also notes that investment in existing fossil fuel supply projects is still needed in the NZE

Scenario to ensure that supply does not fall faster than the decline in demand. This includes the use of in-fill

drilling and improved management of reservoirs as well as some enhanced oil recovery and tight oil drilling to

avoid a sudden near-term drop in supply.

12



Non-diversified Groups

Refers to non-state-owned Energy Groups that generate almost all

of their revenues from upstream oil \& gas activities (i.e.,

exploration, development and production).



Oil Sands Refers to naturally occurring deposits of water and clay, containing a

heavy, viscous oil called bitumen.



Oil Sands exploration and

production companies



Refers to Groups that majority own (\>50%) or operate oil sands

exploration, production \& Oil Sands processing assets, excluding

those that generate less than 10% of revenue from these

activities.



Oil Sands pipelines Refers to pipelines whose primary use is for the transportation of

crude oil extracted from oil sands.



Oil Sands processing Refers to Canadian oil sands clients that process and upgrade

extracted oil sands bitumen in situ only.



Project Finance



Refers to transactions that are a form of loan financing originated

by Barclays (either as an agent or as part of a syndicate) where the

repayment depends primarily on the project’s cash flow and on the

collateral value of the project’s assets. Project Finance excludes

corporate level asset financing.



Reserve-based lending

agreement



Refers to a type of asset-based lending whereby a loan is secured

by collateral. Reserved-based lending is commonly used in the oil \&

gas sector, where such loans are secured by an oil \& gas field or a

portfolio of undeveloped or developed and producing oil \& gas

assets – known as the borrowing base. These facilities are typically

multi-banked, and the asset base is approved subject to majority

lender consent.



Revenue from thermal coal-fired

power generation



Refers to revenues attributable directly to the generation of

electricity from thermal coal and excludes any other revenues

including revenues attributable to the transmission and

distribution of electricity.



Sustainable Finance or

Transition Finance



Refers to transactions that qualify under Barclays’ Sustainable

Finance Framework or Transition Finance Framework as amended

from time to time.



Thermal Coal

Thermal coal (also known as steam coal) are grades of coal used for

power and heat generation. These typically include lignite and

subbituminous grades of coal.



Ultra-Deep Water Refers to waters where the water depth is 1,500 metres or more.
