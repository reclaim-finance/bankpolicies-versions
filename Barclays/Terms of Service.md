Background



Our Climate Strategy



In March 2020, Barclays announced its ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, becoming one of the first

banks to do so.



We have a three-part strategy to turn our net zero ambition into action:



1. Achieving net-zero operations | Barclays is working to reduce its Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3

operational emissions consistent with a 1.5°C aligned pathway and counterbalance any residual

emissions.

2. Reducing our financed emissions | Barclays is committed to aligning its financing with the goals

and timelines of the Paris Agreement, consistent with limiting the increase in global

temperatures to 1.5°C.

3. Financing the transition | Barclays is helping to provide the green and sustainable finance

required to transform the economies, customers and clients we serve.



Our strategy (including our climate strategy) reflects our Purpose and is driven by consideration of all

relevant risks and considerations.



Over the coming years, our strategy will continue to evolve. It will need to adapt to reflect market,

technological, regulatory and geopolitical developments affecting the shape and timing of the transition

to a low-carbon economy. We will keep our policies, targets and progress under review in light of the

rapidly changing external environment and the need to support governments and clients in delivering an

orderly energy transition, integrating social considerations and providing energy security. Progress may

vary and we need to be able to adapt our approach to maintain our support for the transition, whilst

remaining focused on our ambition of becoming a net zero bank by 2050.



Updated Climate Change Statement



We have reviewed our restrictions and conditions to financing of sensitive sectors taking into account

relevant risk and other considerations as well as our Purpose. This updated Climate Change Statement

sets out our approach to financing sensitive sectors and includes new restrictions on financing upstream

oil \& gas, as well as Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) requirements for biomass.



Words in italics are defined in the Key Definitions table and clarify the intended scope of this statement.

Restricted - External



Oil \& Gas

Upstream Oil \& Gas

Project Level

From the date of this statement,

• we will not provide project finance for expansion projects or infrastructure projects

primarily to be used for such expansion projects.

• we will not provide other direct financing to Energy Groups for expansion projects or

infrastructure projects primarily to be used for such expansion projects.



Entity Level

Client Transition Framework (CTF)

We assess the information available on Energy Groups’ plans for alignment with our emissions

reduction targets through the Client Transition Framework (CTF) against several factors

including, but not limited to, the following:

• Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets, including methane.

• Scope 3 absolute emissions reduction targets/ commitments.

• Plans to expand production.

• Low carbon business model activities and plans.



By 1 January 2025, we expect all Energy Groups to be producing relevant information in relation

to their transition plans or decarbonisation strategies.



Client Transition Review Forum (CTRF)

We have established a senior Client Transition Review Forum (CTRF) to carry out targeted

reviews of Groups subject to a CTF assessment. These are informed by the CTF assessment and

take into account consideration of relevant risks and other business factors. These reviews help

determine our financing appetite (including consideration of client retention and conditions to

refinancings) alongside implications for our emissions reduction targets and commercial, credit

and reputational impacts.



Energy Groups meeting any of the following will be subject to mandatory annual review by the

CTRF to determine whether continued financing support is appropriate in the context of their

investment plans and overall decarbonisation or transition plans:

• Energy Groups where more than 10% of their total planned upstream oil \& gas capital

expenditure is in expansion.

• Non-diversified Groups

o We recognise that Non-diversified Groups may present greater transition risk than

diversified Energy Groups, in particular those engaged in long-lead expansion.

o We have very limited appetite for Non-diversified Groups where they are engaged in

long-lead expansion - see below for further details.

• Energy Groups with the lowest CTF assessment scores.



Notwithstanding the outcomes of the CTRF reviews, financing decisions are transaction specific

and will continue to be subject to consideration by relevant committees, if appropriate, to

consider issues such as credit risk, reputational risk and capital impact.



From 1 January 2025 any new financing or renewal of existing financing for Non-diversified Groups

where more than 10% of their total planned oil \& gas capital expenditure is in long-lead expansion

would be by exception.

5



Restricted - External



Minimum requirements

From 1 January 2026 we will only provide financing to Energy Groups if they are able to

demonstrate that they are committed to reducing their own emissions by having:

• net zero-aligned near-term Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets (absolute or

intensity-based); and

• targets to reduce methane emissions by 2030, aligned with OGCI, OGMP2.0, or similar

industry guidance; and

• a commitment to end all routine / non-essential venting and flaring by 2030.

8



Restricted - External



Approach to EDD

We conduct EDD on a case-by-case basis on Groups in scope of this Statement. This approach is risk

based and Groups are analysed against specific environmental and social risk considerations in addition

to the above requirements which include, but are not limited to:

i. The Group’s adherence to the Equator Principles (if a project finance or credit transaction is

deemed to be in scope) including, where appropriate, any relevant International Finance

Corporation (IFC) performance standards;

ii. The Group’s adherence to local and national environmental regulation and standards and industry

best practice;

iii. The Group’s management and implementation of procedures which minimise direct

environmental impacts in the context of their operations;

iv. The Group’s disclosures in relation to corporate governance and oversight of climate change

issues and associated corporate risks, including disclosure against principles such as the

Financial Stability Board (FSB) Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and

appropriate transition plans;

v. The Group’s approach to and track record in protecting the health and safety of the workforce

and local communities;

vi. The Group’s approach to stakeholder engagement and consultation, including its commitment

and adherence to the principles of Free Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) where indigenous peoples

may be impacted by their operations;

vii. The Group’s approach to identifying and addressing its human rights impacts, including through

due diligence.



Additional EDD questions will vary by sector, for instance, in addition to the EDD criteria outlined above,

for Biomass, this process will also consider the sustainable sourcing of feedstock.



External technical input may be obtained to assist the business in reviewing and assessing whether

certain Group activities meet our internal EDD criteria, or where there is uncertainty as to whether a

certain activity is within scope of our EDD criteria. Barclays will continue to align its approach to sensitive

sectors with developments in government and public policy.



In order to assist and enhance the EDD process, we operate a mandatory training programme for

relevant colleagues.

Applicability of financing restrictions

In relation to new restrictions which apply from the date of this statement, whilst we intend to begin

applying them from this date, it will take us some time to fully implement the internal systems and

controls necessary to apply these restrictions (which we aim to have established by 30 June 2024).

Accordingly, there may be transactions that are not identified during this period or, at the point in time

at which a transaction is identified, Barclays determines it would be commercially unreasonable not to

proceed with the transaction.



Any existing commitments or financing entered into prior to any of the restrictions coming into effect

under the Upstream Oil \& Gas and Unconventional Oil \& Gas sections of this statement may remain in

place (but refinancings of any such commitments or financing shall be subject to the restrictions

described above).



In certain cases, we may enter into Sustainable Finance or Transition Finance Transactions with an entity in

a Group that would otherwise be restricted as a result of the application of the Upstream Oil \& Gas section

of this statement where Barclays is satisfied that any Sustainable Finance or Transition Finance

Transactions provided to it will not be used directly to support oil \& gas activity.

Disclosures

We intend to disclose in our annual reporting, subject to maintaining client confidentiality, the following:

• Client Transition Review Forum composition and governance (in Annual Report 2023)

• In relation to the CTF assessments in the Energy Sector, the CTF analysis of outcomes by client

count and lending limits, for the relevant financial year

• The combined number and aggregate value of exceptions granted for the relevant financial year

to:

o Non-diversified Groups under the “Non-diversified Groups restrictions” above (for financial

years starting on or after 1 January 2025), and

o Energy Groups we have provided financing to which have a near term Scope 1 and 2

emissions reduction target (absolute or intensity-based) date falling after 2030 and where

exceptions have been approved by Barclays Group Sustainability Committee (for financial

years starting on or after 1 January 2026).



Governance

This statement will be reviewed annually by the Barclays Group Sustainability Committee. Any revisions

are approved by the Head of Public Policy \& Corporate Responsibility and any material changes of

strategy or policy are referred to the Board Sustainability Committee. This statement is also noted by

the Group Executive Committee.



Referral and escalation procedure

Where Groups are assessed as higher risk following either an enhanced due diligence review or following

a CTRF assessment they will be considered for escalation to the appropriate business review committee

for consideration and a decision on whether to proceed if transaction related.



Should the issues be assessed as presenting material reputational risk they would be escalated to the

Group Reputation Risk Committee, which comprises members of the Group Executive Committee.



Third party data

To the extent this statement requires the assessment of a client or Group’s activities, production

information, revenue, or other financial information including but not limited to information in relation to

clients’ transition or decarbonisation plans, we rely primarily on publicly available information or

information provided by third party data providers (including aggregators of public data). We note,

however, that such data/information can be challenging to obtain, verify and assess. Where data is not

available or is not of a reliably high quality, this may impact our ability to apply restrictions and other

provisions set out in this statement. Barclays shall have no liability for any errors or omissions in

connection with any third-party data which it relies on and considers to be credible.

(i.e., exploration, development and production) and/or Groups that are

considered to be supermajor or major integrated oil \& gas companies.



Engaged in



In relation to Thermal Coal Mining and Thermal Coal Power, a client is

defined as “engaged in” if it generates more than 5% of its revenues

from the activity.

In relation to Amazon Oil \& Gas, a client is defined as “engaged in” if

11

more than 5% of its expenditure (CAPEX and OPEX) are on oil \& gas

projects in the Amazon Biome.



Expansion

Refers to any upstream oil \& gas projects with a final investment

decision (or equivalent) after 31 December 2021. This includes, but is

not limited to, exploration, development, and production.

Finance or financing



Refers to all primary financing activity through lending (including

reserve-based lending agreements), underwriting, arranging and/or

distribution of debt or equity, as well as trade and working capital

finance and excludes, without limitation, any debt or securities traded

or placed through secondary market activity.



Barclays may occasionally continue to be involved in primary financing

activity for distressed entities such as (without limitation) debt for

equity swaps and other recapitalisation activities. When undertaking

such activity, Barclays has a responsibility to minimise losses and will

look to deploy possible financing options to manage distressed

positions and/or maximise recoveries where it is a liability holder. Such

financing arrangements are not typically for the purposes of funding

the ongoing operational activity of the distressed entity. Accordingly,

any such activity is excluded from the definition of financing.



Group(s) In relation to any entity, the relevant parent company and its

consolidated subsidiaries, as a whole.



Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking)

Refers to an oil \& gas well development technique, using a high-

pressure injection of liquid into the rock, which creates fracturing and

allows natural gas and oil to flow more freely.

Material expansion



In relation to Thermal Coal Mining, refers to an increase in annual

tonnage of thermal coal extracted from existing thermal coal mines,

including captives, by more than 20%, measured from a baseline of

maximum p.a. tonnage for preceding 3 years reported.

In relation to Thermal Coal Power, production refers to an investment

to (i) extend the unabated operating lifetime of existing thermal coal

power plants including captives or (ii) increase net operational thermal

power capacity, including captives, by more than 10% measure from a

baseline of maximum capacity for preceding 3 years reported.

Material expansion in such cases relates to absolute global increases

rather than increases for an entity or Group as a result of mergers or

acquisitions.



Materially engaged in – Arctic Circle For Arctic Circle, Groups are defined as “materially engaged in” if they

have over 20% revenue from oil \& gas activities in the Arctic Circle or



1 This definition is informed by the IEA Net Zero Roadmap, 2023 update which highlights that the decline in fossil fuel

demand in the IEA NZE Scenario means that no new long-lead time oil \& gas projects are approved for development. It

also notes that investment in existing fossil fuel supply projects is still needed in the NZE Scenario to ensure that

supply does not fall faster than the decline in demand. This includes the use of in-fill drilling and improved management

of reservoirs as well as some enhanced oil recovery and tight oil drilling to avoid a sudden near-term drop in supply.

12



Restricted - External



have approved capital investment for new exploration and production

or new pipeline transportation of oil \& gas within the Arctic Circle.



Materially engaged in – Fracking

For Hydraulic Fracturing, Groups are defined as “materially engaged in”

if they have over 20% revenue from Fracking activities in the UK and

Europe.



Mountain Top Removal (MTR) coal

mining

existing client of Barclays.



Non-diversified Groups

Refers to non-state-owned Energy Groups that generate almost all of

their revenues from upstream oil \& gas activities (i.e., exploration,

development and production).



Oil Sands Refers to naturally occurring deposits of water and clay, containing a

heavy, viscous oil called bitumen.



Oil Sands exploration and production

companies



Refers to Groups that majority own (\>50%) or operate oil sands

exploration, production \& Oil Sands processing assets, excluding those

Oil Sands processing Refers to Canadian oil sands clients that process and upgrade

extracted oil sands bitumen in situ only.



Project Finance



Refers to transactions that are a form of loan financing originated by

Barclays (either as an agent or as part of a syndicate) where the

repayment depends primarily on the project’s cash flow and on the

collateral value of the project’s assets. Project Finance excludes
