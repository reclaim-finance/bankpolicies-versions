Group Responsible Financing Policy

1 General



Erste Group was founded with a clear purpose: to promote and secure prosperity for all people in the

region. This mission continues to guide the Group’s strategy, which integrates key Environmental,

Social, and Governance (ESG) themes as essential drivers of long-term success and inclusive growth.

As a major financial institution in Central and Eastern Europe, Erste Group plays a critical role in

financing the transition of the real economy. Achieving the transition to a low carbon economy

requires coordinated efforts across the financial system and the broader economy. Erste Group is

committed to enabling this transformation by supporting clients in their own climate journeys.

The Group is committed to science-based decarbonisation pathways and to the goals of the Paris

Climate Agreement. Sustainable finance is not only a strategic priority but a key enabler of the green

transition. Erste Group is providing targeted financial solutions to help clients implement climate

strategies, seize green opportunities, and manage climate-related risks. Ongoing engagement with

clients remains central to a shared and successful decarbonisation journey.



1.1 Objective

The Group Responsible Financing Policy (the Policy) outlines industry-specific ESG exclusion and

phase-out criteria, including thresholds and guidelines for determining transaction eligibility to

prevent ESG related credit and reputational risk. It also defines non-financial risk profiles that trigger

enhanced risk management support. Additionally, the policy describes assessment procedures for

specific sectors and subsectors to ensure informed decision-making aligned with our commitment to

providing responsible financing services.

Group Responsible Financing Policy

2 Overview of Functional Roles and Responsibilities



2.1 Group Functional Roles

2.1.1 Policy Owner

The Policy Owner refers to the team responsible for the implementation and oversight of the policy

within the organization. At Holding Level, the Policy Owner is represented by the ESG Function within

Credit Risk Portfolio, which is also responsible for the Policy’s content and alignment with Erste

Group’s financing principles.



2.1.2 First and second line of control



Business Units comprise by

i) All Corporate segments – Large Corporates, Small \& Mid Cap Enterprises, Public Sector,

Commercial Real Estate, as well as

ii) Markets’ Segments and Financial Institutions together with all corresponding product units



First Line of Control

Business, in collaboration with Credit Underwriting, constitutes the first line of control. Business acts

as the deal originator, being directly or indirectly connected to the transaction in question and holds

day-to-day responsibility for making financing decisions in line with the Policy. Ahead of being

transferred to the second line of control, Credit Underwriting serves as an additional reviewer,

verifying the plausibility of the information provided by Business and ensuring alignment with Policy

principles.



Second line of control – Credit Risk, Non-Financial Risk

At Holding Level, the second line of control is fulfilled by the ESG Function within Credit Risk Portfolio.

The ESG Function within Credit Risk Portfolio holds ultimate ownership of the Group Responsible

Financing Policy, and is responsible for the content, implementation, and oversight of the Policy with

support of local Risk Functions within local entities.

Group Responsible Financing Policy

3 Responsible Financing Policy Process



An assessment shall be initiated at the earliest convenience when a transaction or target transaction

falls within, or potentially falls within, the scope of this Policy. In case of uncertainty, Business or

Non-Financial Risk Team must promptly consult the respective Policy Owner for clarification.



3.1 Criteria Categories

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the policy distinguishes between two categories of

criteria:

 Exclusion Criteria

Refers to transactions that fall under the Policy’s hard exclusions. These are predefined areas

– where no risk acceptance through a Non-Financial Risk (NFR) decision is permitted.

 Non-Eligibility Criteria

Refers to transactions that do not fall within the pre-approved risk appetite outlined in the

Policy. While these transactions are not automatically excluded, they require further

assessment and may be escalated through the defined escalation procedure, as detailed in

Chapter 3.3 of this Policy



3.2 Process Steps



The following steps shall be applied:

1. Assess whether the transaction falls within the scope of the Group Responsible Financing

Policy.

2. Evaluate Policy Alignment

 Aligned Transactions: Proceed without further intervention.

 Non-Aligned Transactions: Either discontinue or escalate for review under the Group

Non-Financial Risk Management framework.

 Excluded Transactions: Activities prohibited by the Policy (e.g., controversial weapons

or those exceeding defined thresholds) are categorically ineligible for approval.

 Defense-Related Micro Clients: Financing is permissible only if fully compliant with the

principles outlined in the Policy; non-compliant cases cannot be approved.

3.3 Non-Financial Risk – Country Index



The Non-Financial Risk Country Index (NFR-CI) bundles several internationally accepted indices

measuring the status of the covered country based on legal, political and economic standards. A

predetermined procedure by Group Non-Financial Risk Management function assesses a final score

for the Defense Industry, the Energy Sector, Biodiversity and the Gaming Sector for each country.

This is used as an input for the decision grid (see chapter 4.3.2 Defense Sector – Decision Grid). If no

value is available in the NFR-CI for a country, the local Non-Financial Risk Management Function – or,

if not implemented, the Group Function – shall be consulted.

Group Responsible Financing Policy

4 Defense Sector



4.1 Defense Sector – Objectives

Our Approach

Erste Group recognizes the adverse impact of controversial, such as nuclear weapons on the

environment, health of society, and humanitarian principles. Erste Group acknowledges responsibility

to society and maintain a clear stance against financing such weapons. Other parts of the defense

industry are only considered for financing within well-defined rules.

At the same time, Erste Group acknowledges that in recent years, a rapidly shifting geopolitical

landscape – marked by increased security threats, armed conflict on European soil, and growing

concerns over strategic dependencies – has fundamentally reshaped the strategic importance of the

defense sector in Europe. These developments have elevated expectations on financial institutions to

play a role in supporting the continent’s collective security, industrial resilience, and defense

readiness, as outlined in the EU White Paper on Defence Readiness 2030). However, this must be

done responsibly and with full adherence to law, humanitarian principles, and our internal risk and

ESG standards. Erste Group aims to balance its role as a responsible financial institution with the

growing need for security investment in Europe.



Context of EU Policy Change

In March 2025, the European Commission issued the EU White Paper on Defence Readiness 2030.

The paper sets out a strategic framework for greater resilience, industrial readiness, and strategic

autonomy on our continent. Furthermore, it acknowledges the critical role of financial institutions in

enabling this transformation – particularly in allocating and mobilizing capital for defense innovation,

enhancing defense production and capacity, supporting dual-use technologies, and strengthening the

EU’s defense industrial base.



4.2 Defense Sector – Scope

In Scope Definitions

 Transactions with producers or dealers of weapons and firearms

 Transactions with producers or dealers of components \& spare parts of weapons or firearms

 Transactions with producers or dealers of dual use products

 Transactions in connection with the acquisition of products mentioned above

 Transactions in connection with storage, import and export of products mentioned above

 General Purpose Financing

Group Responsible Financing Policy



Out of Scope Definitions

 Hunting \& Sporting weapons and firearms

 General corporate banking relationships – defined as current accounts, deposits, and

payments services that are not directly connected to the sale, purchase or transport of non-

eligible products or services within the defense industry.



4.3 Defense Sector – Guidelines

As a financial institution, Erste Group ́s commitment to ethical conduct is the foremost priority.

Accordingly, Erste Group has developed a rigorous assessment, ensuring strategic alignment with the

EU White Paper on Defence Readiness 2030 by evaluating:

(1) Weapon Type Restriction – Transactions involving controversial weapons – including but

not limited to biological, chemical, nuclear weapons, cluster munitions, and fully

autonomous weapons systems operating without meaningful human control – are strictly

excluded from banking services as defined in Chapter 4.3.1. of this Policy

(2) Geographical Scope Requirements – Banking services shall only be provided where the

counterparty and end-users are based in

 European Union (EU) Member States

 Erste Group Home Markets \& Extended Erste Group Home Markets

 NATO Member States with NFR-CI from level 1 to 5

 EU Strategic Defense Partners with NFR-CI from level 1 to 5

Group Responsible Financing Policy



Not Eligible for new financing in the defense sector if any of the following are met:

 Transactions directly or indirectly associated with human rights violations, including but not

limited to activities involving forced labor, unlawful surveillance, or the suppression of civil

liberties are not eligible for financing. Erste Group refers to UN Guiding Principles of Business

and Human rights for reference.

 The beneficiary of the transaction and/or the destination of the underlying goods is in a

country that:

i. is subject to a United Nations, European Union or any other relevant national

weapons embargo,

ii. does not meet our Non-Financial Risk – Country Index Criteria

iii. in the event of compliance-related concerns— such as those related to Anti-

Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorism Financing, sanctions and export

controls, or anti-bribery and corruption—the transaction may proceed under

standard risk governance

Please note that even within countries classified under NFR-CPI levels 1–5, specific regions

may be subject to restrictions or full blocks—such as the currently restricted areas in

Ukraine—based on evolving risk assessments and geopolitical developments.

 The parties involved in the transaction shall have no convictions related to non-compliance

with national arms trade legislation or international sanctions on weapons, nor any convictions

for corruption, illegal taking of interest, misappropriation of public funds for weapons, or

engagement in economic activities within sanctioned territories.

 For defense-related transactions involving micro clients – financing will only be considered if

the transaction fully complies with the principles outlined in this chapter. Transactions that do

not meet the defined criteria are not eligible for risk acceptance under the Non-Financial Risk

Decision Process.



The following criteria must be fulfilled regarding all transaction partners:

 All transactions shall be conducted exclusively with parties who have successfully completed

and passed Anti-Money Laundering Checks, as well as Know Your Customer (KYC)

screenings and are able to provide adequate documentation for each armament-related

transaction.



4.3.1 Weapon Categorization

As part of the initial assessment, the defense product involved in the transaction must be clearly

classified. Erste Group defined five distinct defense categories, as follows:

 Controversial Arms

 Large \& Small Arms represent active military products

 Passive Arms – Non-lethal protective equipment, as well as defensive military goods designed

to provide protection

 Neutral Arms – Goods used for disarmament, disabling or reduction of military capabilities

 Dual Use Goods, Technologies and Components requires contextual evaluation and must be

assessed in conjunction with the associated end-product to determine its operational role.

In case where a defense product comprises multiple components or sub-systems, the classification

shall be based on the most aggressive or combat-relevant feature present.

Public



Group Responsible Financing Policy



Furthermore, Erste Group qualifies Fully Autonomous Weapon Systems (“human-out-of-the-loop”) as

controversial – as defined by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC):

“Autonomous Weapon Systems that, once activated, can select and engage targets without further

intervention by a human operator.”

Furthermore, in the context of EU regulatory standards, in particular the Sustainable Finance

Disclosure Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/2088), “controversial weapons” are defined as “anti-

personnel mines, cluster munitions, chemical weapons and biological weapons”. This is reflected in

the graphic below.

The graphic presented below is intended as a guided framework for clustering weapon types.

However, the list is non-exhaustive, meaning not all weapon types are reflected within the graphic.

4.3.2 Defense Sector – Decision Grid

As outlined in Chapter 3.4 – Non-Financial Risk Country Index (NFR-CI), the decision grid serves as a

key tool to assess transaction eligibility. It enables streamlined processing for certain transaction

types without requiring further escalation, based on two core criteria: the weapon categorization and

the NFR-CI1 2rating of the destination country.

5 Energy Sector



5.1 Energy Sector – Objectives

Erste Group supports the energy sector in its essential role of ensuring energy security and driving

economic development across Central and Eastern Europe, while sensibly managing the

environmental and social impacts. The transition to a low-carbon economy is advanced through

increased support for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects across the region.

Sustainable financing solutions are provided to energy clients to support their transition and

alignment with long-term climate goals. While fossil energy sources may still play a role under

national energy and climate plans (NECPs), the Group applies robust assessment frameworks and

tracks progress against clear decarbonisation targets. These efforts contribute to a secure, resilient,

and sustainable energy future.

Erste Group supports the energy sector in its key roles of providing energy security and developing

the economies in CEE but also in sensibly managing the environmental and social impacts of energy

sector projects. It is emphasized that in the mid- to long-term, economic, social and environmental

well-being are not mutually exclusive, but inherently linked to each other. Therefore, Erste Group

implements principles for the energy sector for a better management of the environmental and

climate risks, as well as energy security and social impacts of actual energy change.

The Energy Sector Principles are based on accepted industry principles, seen by various stakeholders

as representing best practice, and are aligned with Erste Group ́s long-standing commitment to the

Paris Agreement (COP21). Erste Group recognizes the strategic importance of renewable energy and

energy efficiency projects.



5.2 Energy Sector – Scope

The following economic activities and business cases are in scope:

 The exploration, production, transportation, storage, distribution, waste management, trading

and refining of oil \& gas (including processing of other hydrocarbons), solid fossil fuels and

nuclear fuel cycle activities (mining, processing, conversion, enrichment, as well as back-end

activities, such as decommissioning and reprocessing of spent fuel)

 Production, transportation, storage, distribution of biofuels and other sustainable fuels;

 The generation of power and/or heat/cold by means of fossil-fired power plants (such as oil,

gas and coal-fired power plants), nuclear power plants and power plants based on renewable

energy sources (hydro, wind, thermal solar, photovoltaic solar, geothermal, biogas and

biomass energy);

 The transmission and distribution of power or heat/cold generated by such power plants;

 The production of technical components (i.e. semi-finished and finished products, incl. spare

parts) for plants of the energy sources referenced above. Financing of production of

components in general is not in scope; the components shall only be considered in scope

when the components can be assigned to only a specific type of power plant (e.g.

transformers for a nuclear power plant or transformers for a gas thermal power plant).

 Projects in connection with the phase-out/closing of power plants (nuclear, thermal, hydro,

etc.).

 Services related to the above-mentioned activities (e.g. maintenance, construction of access

road to a power plant).

Public



Group Responsible Financing Policy



5.3 Energy Sector – Guidelines

Erste Group will provide banking services to the energy sector only if such projects or transactions:

 Are in compliance with national and international environmental laws (www.ecolex.org is

regarded as the most comprehensive information source).

 Comply with EU Taxonomy’s Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria for protection of

biodiversity and ecosystems as described in Chapter 6 – Biodiversity.

Additional sector specific guidelines and criteria shall be applied to the following energy sources. For

the avoidance of doubt, potential projects / activities and transactions that qualify as

“environmentally sustainable” within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy are always considered eligible

for financing by Erste Group.



5.4 Fossil Fuels (Oil \& Gas)

Key risks identification

 Oil and gas have a severe impact on environmental degradation creating significant risks and

impact on biodiversity, water quality and marine resources caused by exploration and harbors

the risk of human rights violations through forced expropriation and the risk of violations of

workers' rights;

 Oil and gas burning for power generation contributes to high exposure to climate change

through GHG emissions;

 Associated activities are exposed to secondary reputational and litigation risks.



Policy objectives

Erste Group is committed to not expand its exposure of oil and gas exploration financing unless it is

crucial for energy independence from Russia and is indispensable for national energy security within

Europe. Erste Group does not finance extraction methods in unconventional sectors and generally

projects within the Arctic region.



Eligible at client level:

 The corporate has established an Environmental Action Plan that comprehensively addresses

all issues identified in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)￼ – including, but not

limited to, contingency measures for oil spills and the prohibition of continuous venting of

associated gas into the atmosphere. In addition, the plan must include clearly defined

mitigation actions aimed at preventing, minimizing, or offsetting adverse environmental

impacts throughout the project lifecycle; and

 No more than 20% of the corporate’s turnover is derived from activities classified as

unconventional extraction methods, as defined in Chapter 5.4.1.

 The client is committed to respecting human and labour rights in the conduct of its business;

and has implemented a stakeholder engagement plan that provides for a consultation process

with communities that might be affected where applicable.

Public



Group Responsible Financing Policy



Eligible at deal level:

 Have no material adverse effects on protected natural habitats, critical freshwater resources

or marine reserves as defined in Chapter 6 – Biodiversity;

 Are not mainly located in areas of high risk (i.e. areas of conflict or of geological and

environmental hazards);

 Are not dedicated upstream and midstream projects in unconventional extraction sectors

such as fracking activities. No financing of oil and gas exploration and greenfield development

(upstream and midstream activities directly linked to exploration activities); exceptions

allowed for the segment of natural gas in the event of the project supporting the

independence from Russia and is indispensable for national energy security within Europe.



5.4.1 Definition of Unconventional Methods



5.4.1.1 Oil Sand / Tar Sand

Oil Sands (or Tar Sands) refer to a type of unconventional petroleum deposit consisting of a mixture

of sand, water, clay, and bitumen, which is a thick, tar-like form of crude oil. Unlike conventional oil

which can be pumped directly from reservoirs, bitumen found in oil sands is too viscous to flow on its

own and requires specialized extraction methods.

The extraction and processing of oil sands is energy-intensive and has significant environmental

concerns, including high greenhouse gas emissions, high water use, and land disruption.



Exclusion Criteria:

No banking services will be provided if the transaction is related to an oil sand / tar sand project or if

more than 20% of the relevant client’s turnover is derived from activities classified as unconventional

methods.



5.4.1.2 Arctic Oil \& Gas

The Arctic region is one of the last pristine natural places left on the planet. It has shallow, biologically

productive seas and vulnerable ecosystem. Arctic seas are serving as an important feeding source for

the fragile communities of whales, seabirds and other wildlife. The region covered by AMAP is,

essentially the terrestrial and marine areas north of the Arctic Circle (66°32'N), and north of 62°N in

Asia and 60°N in North America, modified to include the marine areas north of the Aleutian chain,

Hudson Bay, and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean including the Labrador Sea.

Arctic Oil \& Gas activities are defined as the exploration, drilling, production and transportation of Oil

\& Gas (including LNG) performed in and impacting the Arctic region.

Exploration and industrial activities are harmful for the living and feeding conditions of the fragile

wildlife of the Artic region and can result in environmental degradation and decreasing biodiversity.

Remote proximity, extreme weather conditions and lack of infrastructure means a delayed

mobilization of mitigating measures for industrial accidents, therefore causing far more severe

impacts to the Arctic ecosystem.



Exclusion Criteria:

Erste Group does not want to be exposed to the risks of environmental degradation in the vulnerable

ecosystems of the Arctic region and will therefore refrain from any financing of projects, assets or

cash flows directly related to Arctic Oil \& Gas activities. This restriction applies also to financing of

maintenance or supply chain dedicated directly to the Arctic Oil \& Gas activities.

Public



Group Responsible Financing Policy



5.4.1.3 Hydraulic Fracturing

Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking) produces significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas

that contributes to climate change, especially if there are leaks during extraction. Fracking requires

significant volumes of water, which can strain local water resources. Chemicals used in fracking could

potentially contaminate nearby groundwater sources if not properly managed. The injection of

wastewater into deep wells after fracking has been linked to minor earthquakes, a phenomenon

known as induced seismicity. Additionally, the infrastructure required for fracking, including roads,

drilling pads, and pipelines disrupts local ecosystems and wildlife habitats.



Exclusion Criteria:

No banking services will be provided if the transaction is related to fracking or if more than 20% of

the relevant client’s turnover is derived from activities classified as unconventional methods.



5.5 Thermal Coal

The thermal coal sector is a significant contributor to rising temperatures of the planet and hence has

a responsibility towards society and future generations in terms of environmental preservation,

human rights and human health. Thermal Coal remains a critical energy pillar in several EU countries,

driven not only by its established infrastructure and affordability, but also by the recent geopolitical

shifts that have underscored the urgent need for energy security. In the wake of the ongoing crisis

stemming from reduced access to Russian oil and gas, many countries are prioritizing energy

independence and diversification of their energy mix. In this context, thermal coal continues to serve

as a reliable base-load energy source, particularly in regions, where alternative solutions are still in

development or constrained by infrastructural challenges.

Starting in 2025, Erste Group’s Thermal Coal clients are required to submit transition plans for formal

review. As part of our decision-making process, Erste Group closely monitor the progress and

alignment of National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs), as required by the European Commission.

These plans are of paramount importance, as they provide a clear roadmap for each country’s energy

transition, outlining critical milestones for decarbonization, renewable energy adoption, and the

phase-out of fossil fuels. For us as a Financial Institution, NECPs serve as a key indicator of

governmental commitments and regulatory direction, allowing us to assess the long-term viability of

coal-related assets within the context of a nation’s broader climate strategy. They help us to evaluate

the credibility of client transition strategies and ensure that our financing aligns with both national and

EU-wide climate objectives, as well as our own targets.

Erste Group pursues a clearly defined coal exit approach that balances responsibility for climate

action with the need to ensure energy security in the CEE region. Many of the CEE markets still

heavily rely on fossil fuels, and the transition to renewable energy requires both time and substantial

investment. Erste Group recognizes the urgency of contributing to the decarbonization of the energy

sector while at the same time ensuring that households and businesses have continuous access to

affordable energy. Against this background two-step exit are set out:

 From 2030 onwards, Erste Group will no longer finance coal mining,

 And from 2035 Erste Group will refrain from financing power or heat generation from coal.

The extension period is exclusively available to clients of Erste Group which hold an existing

relationship at the time of transaction decision. Eligibility is contingent upon the demonstration of

credible and actionable transition efforts that are fully aligned with the National Energy and Climate

Plan (NECP) of their respective country, as outlined in Chapter 5.5.1 Thermal Coal – Decision Grid for

Extension Period.

5.6 Nuclear Energy



Erste Group has a very restrictive approach concerning projects in the nuclear energy industry. Due

to the long radioactive half-life of nuclear waste and the difficulties involved in its final storage, it is

not in Erste Group’s interest to see nuclear energy capacities extended. Erste Group acknowledges

that countries in the region that Erste Group is active in, have declared that they currently must rely

on nuclear power to ensure energy security. However, Erste Group will only finance - if at all - any

projects related to nuclear power plants if these projects are of indispensable importance to a

country’s energy security.



Non-eligible projects and transactions:

 All transactions related to expanding nuclear power plant projects (not EU Taxonomy aligned)

and all related projects (e.g. access roads, security systems for new nuclear plants), as well

as components, spare parts required for the operation of the new power plant if these

projects are not considered to be of indispensable importance to its national energy security

by a country.

 Projects relating to the mining of uranium, as well as the conversion, enrichment, processing

and storage of nuclear fuel.



Eligible projects and transactions:

 Transactions concerning existing and operational nuclear power plants that are considered to

be of indispensable importance to the national energy security by a country:

o if they increase the safety standards (incl. better security systems against accidents

or violent attacks) of the respective power plants;

o if they relate to the acquisition of spare parts, vital components and necessary

maintenance which are required for the operation of those plants, with the rationale

that without the replacement of the respective parts and the related maintenance

works a safe and adequate functioning of the respective plant could not be ensured;

o if they concern projects and related costs for decommissioning existing nuclear power

plants, while ensuring the highest safety standards.

 Projects related to new nuclear power plant projects and related investments are eligible only:

o if they meet the criteria of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214,

including those that they ensure no significant harm is done to other environmental

objectives;

o if they are considered to be of indispensable importance to the national energy

security by a country.

 The decommissioning, reprocessing, storage of domestic nuclear waste.



In addition, eligible transactions need to comply with certain safety, legal and security standards

which can be ascertained based on the assessment of the country (Energy NFR-CI) where the

respective project or transaction will take place. Nuclear deals are only deemed eligible for countries

within Erste Group Home Markets and EU countries with an Energy NFR-CI from Country Index 1 to 5,

all others are deemed non-eligible.

5.7 Renewables

Increasing the share of renewable energy across the different sectors of the economy is a key

building block to reaching the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Erste Group’s ambition is

to gradually increase the share of renewables in the total energy credit portfolio.



5.7.1 Biofuels / Biomass

Erste Group will provide financing, advisory or any other banking services if such projects or deals

 clearly identify the type of the biomass (agricultural/forest);

 ensure that production of digestate covers monitoring and contingency plan (to minimize

methane leakage at the facility) and produced biogas is used directly for the generation of

electricity or heat or upgraded to bio-methane for injection in natural gas grad or used as

vehicle fuel or feedstock in the chemical industry;

 have no significant negative impact on environment (e.g. biodiversity), food supply security

and biodiversity;

 have no adverse effects on the sustainable use of soils, critical natural habitats such as rain

forests or other territories outlined in Chapter 6 of this Policy or critical freshwater resources;

 do not substantially increase water usage compared to the previous usage of the area from

which biomass originates.



5.7.2 Hydro Power and other Renewables

Erste Group will provide banking services – as defined in the introduction – only if the related

transactions or projects meet the following criteria:

 comply with the World Commission on Dams (WCD) Framework in the case of hydro plants

and international conventions such as the European Union Water Framework Directive and Art

4 Directive (EU) 2000/60/EC);

 comply with the EU Taxonomy’s Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria for protection of

biodiversity and ecosystems (for more details, refer to Chapter 6 below)

 includes an impact assessment prior to construction of the project to assess all its potential

impacts on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on protected habitats

and species directly dependent on water, considering in particular migration corridors, free-

flowing rivers or ecosystems close to unimpaired conditions; and includes all technically

feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce

adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on

water (evidence is provided by documentation of environmental impact assessment or other

official documentation).



For Small Hydro Power Plant Projects, the following minimum standards are to be met (current and

future projects):

 Technical due diligence conducted by an independent consultant - taking into account the

following aspects: project location (protected and forest areas), residents within the proximity

of construction site, land use permit, cultural heritage within 1 km of the site, installation of

oil-based transformers, capacity of the energy generation, location of the site within fish or

wildlife migration areas etc.;

Public



Group Responsible Financing Policy



 Due Diligence of Environmental and Social Impact Analysis (ESIA) or in the absence of a legal

obligation for ESIA, an ESIA report shall be prepared by a third-party consultant, including a

site visit by the third party;

 Water quality and sedimentation measurements are conducted annually. Semi-annual

monitoring of all projects, as well as annual site visits by an internal/external specialist.



5.8 Energy Sector – Decision Grid

For the purpose of the Decision grid, energy sector deals are categorized into three main energy

source groups:

i) Nuclear,

ii) Fossil fuels,

iii) Renewable and others.

The potential project or transaction must comply with both the relevant Policy principles for the

energy source in question and certain safety standards, which can be determined on the basis of the

assessment of the country in which the project or transaction is to be carried out.

The following country ratings signal the eligibility of a deal, provided that all other principles

mentioned in chapter 5.3 of the Policy are met:



 Nuclear: Erste Home Markets or EU countries with Energy Non-Financial Risk – Country Index

between levels 1 to 5 and limitations as stated for non-eligible cases (see Chapter 5.6 of this

Policy)

 Fossil fuels: no geographical limitation; non-eligible criteria as per Chapter 5.4 of this Policy

 Renewables and other: no geographical limitation; non-eligible criteria as per Chapter 5.7 of

this Policy

6 Biodiversity



Erste Group recognizes that biodiversity is foundational to the stability of ecosystems and the global

economy. Climate Change, as well as the degradation of natural systems and environments present

material risks to the financial sector, including credit, operational, and reputational exposures. Erste

Group acknowledges its role in identifying, assessing, mitigating and managing biodiversity-related

risks and impacts within our financing and investment activities. By integrating biodiversity-related

factors into our responsible financing practices and decision-making processes, Erste Group aims to

support the protection of ecosystems and contribute to a more resilient, sustainable future for our

planet.

Erste Group carries out a comprehensive analysis of biodiversity risks in relation to transactions in

scope of this Policy and conducts due diligence on clients to understand their impact on, and

vulnerability to, climate-related and environmental risks. The assessment is carried out using the

tools “ENCORE” and the “WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter”. These tools enable the connection between

economic activities and their impacts, including potential harm to biodiversity.

For the avoidance of doubt, potential projects / activities and transactions that qualify as

“environmentally sustainable” within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy are always considered eligible

for financing by Erste Group.



6.1 Land and soil management

Key Risk Identification

Soil is an essential, non-renewable resource for agriculture, providing the basis for the production of

food, fibre, and other resources for a circular bioeconomy. Soil also supports biodiversity, plays a

central role in carbon sequestration and storage, and provides a number of other ecosystem services,

such as water regulation and nutrient cycling.



Policy objective:

Erste Group will not provide financing, advisory and any other banking services to entities that:

contribute to degradation of land by adopting intensive practices (intensive tillage practices - (e.g.

more than 3 tillage/year except cover crops - that disturb the earth's structure and contribute to

degradation like deforestation overgrazing, intensive cultivation and construction work on/of land

under special protection such as e.g. rainforests or the last remaining virgin forests in Europe);

damage biodiversity as a consequence of practicing monocultures (agricultural or forestry land on

which only one crop species is cultivated for more than 5 consecutive years);

practice land abandonment and neglect, especially use agricultural land for other purposes, with the

exceptions permitted by the law.



Non-eligible projects / deals

Unless they qualify as “environmentally sustainable” within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy, Erste

Group will not finance any activities or projects located in or which have a material impact on:

 UNESCO World Natural Heritage Sites

 Wetlands of International importance on the Ramsar List

 IUCN-listed protected areas (category I and II areas, or

 Natura 2000.

Public



Group Responsible Financing Policy



Prior to approval of financing for large-scale high-impact project, the corporate must submit a

comprehensive assessment detailing the project’s environmental and social implications. A project

may be considered for financing only if it demonstrably complies with internationally recognized

environmental and social standards – including the IFC Performance Standards, EBRD Performance

Requirements, and the Equator Principles – and is supported by a positive Environmental Impact

Assessment (EIA) conducted in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU. The EIA must confirm that

appropriate mitigation measures are in place, with particular attention to impacts on protected areas.

The corporate is responsible for providing documented evidence of compliance and mitigation as part

of the financing application.

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive, also known as Directive 2011/92/EU, is an

EU-wide legal framework that requires certain public and private projects to undergo a formal

environmental assessment process, before receiving development consent. The aim is to ensure that

environmental factors are identified early, considered transparently, and integrated into decision-

making.



This policy applies primarily to clients and projects subject to mandatory Environmental Impact

Assessments (EIAs) under Directive 2011/92/EU. The directive targets large-scale developments

with potentially significant environmental effects, such as intensive agricultural operations, major

land-use changes, or projects located in ecologically sensitive areas.



Financing may be considered in alignment with this policy if both the project and the client fully

comply with all regulatory and legal requirements under the EIA framework, and no material

environmental concerns are identified.



In the agricultural sector, additional considerations apply regarding subsidy frameworks, particularly

those governed by the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and relevant national funding

programs. Projects that are EIA-obligated and simultaneously benefit from agricultural subsidies must

demonstrate full compliance with both environmental and subsidy-related regulations. Financing is

permissible in such cases, provided regulatory alignment is ensured.



6.2 Deforestation

Land clearance for commercial agriculture and plantations is by far the largest cause of loss, often

driven primarily by land speculation rather than the absolute need for food production.

Erste Group will make use the existing principles set out in the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030

(which echoes the ambition of the European Green Deal and shall advise financing, do advisory work

or provide any other financing services to entities that ensure that the result of practicing their

activity is not causing any form of degradation of ecosystems as per the impact assessment

according to Directive 2011/92/EU , including the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land that

is then converted to non-forest use



Exclusion Criteria:

 Erste Group will abstain from financing direct or indirect projects / activities involving

deforestation of primary forests and tropical rainforests, and of removal of high conservation

value (HCV2) forests (HCV Approach | HCV Network). Forest-owning forestry companies,

including forest-owning pulp and paper companies operating in high-risk areas - as defined in

the Forest 500 High Risk Country List by NGO Global Canopy - must have Forest Stewardship

Council (FSC) or Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes (PEFC)

certification;

Public



Group Responsible Financing Policy



 Erste Group will abstain from entering new transactions with companies that grow and/or

trade palm oil unless they are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and

have a corresponding RSPO certification;

 Erste Group will abstain from entering new transactions with companies that grow soy in the

Amazon Basin and/or trade soy from the Amazon Basin unless they are certified by the Round

Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS).



6.3 Water quality and reuse in agriculture

While Europe is largely considered as having adequate water resources, water scarcity and drought is

an increasingly frequent and widespread phenomenon in the European Union. The main overall

objective of EU water policy is to ensure access to good quality water in sufficient quantity for all

Europeans, and to ensure the good status of all water bodies across Europe.



Exclusion Criteria

 Projects that do not protect surface waters from chemical pollution and discharged water, and

therewith do not comply with the quality parameters as indicated in the national regulations

(heavy pollution);

 Projects that are non-compliant with EU-Directive 2006/118/EC on the protection of

groundwater against pollution and deterioration.



6.4 Commodity Certification Guidelines

As part of the commitment to sustainability, it is crucial for Erste Group to evaluate the environmental,

social and governance impact of the commodities Erste Group finances. Key commodities are widely

traded and consumed globally. However, these commodities come with significant ESG risks,

particularly regarding deforestation, labor rights, and environmental degradation. Below, Erste Group

outlines key certifications to consider when assessing ESG compliance of these commodities. Erste

Group’s assessment focuses on transactions directly linked to commodity trading clients, prioritizing

engagements within the core commodity value chain.



Palm Oil

Palm Oil is a versatile and highly demanded commodity, but its production has been linked to

significant deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and human rights violations. To mitigate these risks,

Erste Group prioritizes financing palm oil production that adheres to rigorous sustainability standards.

 RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil): The RSPO certification ensures that palm oil is

produced sustainably, with measures to prevent deforestation, promote biodiversity, and

uphold worker’s rights. The RSPO also sets standards for transparency and traceability across

the supply chain.

 ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification): This certification is crucial for

palm oil that claims to reduce carbon emissions and follows environmental and social

sustainability practices. ISCC addresses climate change by focusing on carbon footprint

reduction, biodiversity preservation, and supply chain transparency.

 Rainforest Alliance: Rainforest Alliance certified palm oil is produced in a way that protects

ecosystems and the rights of workers. This certification promotes integrated landscape

management and climate adaption strategies to enhance biodiversity and community well-

being.

Group Responsible Financing Policy



Coffee \& Cocoa

The coffee and cocoa industry faces several ESG challenges, including deforestation, poor labor

conditions, environmental degradation, and the effects of climate change on coffee-growing regions.

To ensure that our financing supports sustainable coffee production, Erste Group considers

certifications that focus on both environmental and social impacts.

 Fair Trade Certified: This certification ensures fair wages and working conditions for

farmers and workers, while promoting sustainable farming practices. Fair Trade also

supports community development and focuses on eliminating exploitative labor practices,

especially for smallholder farmers.

 Rainforest Alliance: Like palm oil, coffee that carries the Rainforest Alliance seal is

produced using methods that conserve biodiversity, protect forests, and support

sustainable farming practices. The certification also emphasizes improving the livelihoods

of coffee farmers, particularly in the face of climate change.



6.5 Biodiversity – Decision Grid

For the purpose of the decision grid, the impact of a project on biodiversity should be assessed using

in the following steps:

i) Location of project (Links regarding protected areas as outlined in Chapter 6.1);

ii) Compliance with the EU Taxonomy’s Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria for

protection of biodiversity and ecosystems:

a. Completion of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or screening

i. For projects / activities in the EU, in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU

on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on

the environment;

ii. For projects / activities in third countries: in accordance with equivalent

applicable national law or international standards requiring the completion

of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), for example, the IFC

Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental

and Social Risks;

Implementation of the required mitigation and compensation measures for

protecting the environment;

b. Conduct of an appropriate assessment, where applicable, where project sites

/operations are located in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura

2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key

Biodiversity Areas, as well as other protected areas)

i. for projects / activities in the EU: in accordance with Directive

2009/147/EC on the conservation of wild birds and Council Directive

92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora

;

ii. for projects / activities in third countries: in accordance with equivalent

applicable national law or international standards, that aim at the

conservation of natural habitats, wild fauna and wild flora, and that require

to carry out

Group Responsible Financing Policy



1\. a screening procedure to determine whether, for a given activity,

an appropriate assessment of the possible impacts on protected

habitats and species is needed;

2\. such assessment, where the screening determines that it is

needed, for example IFC Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity

Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural

Resources; Implementation of the required mitigation measures to

ensure that the project will not have any significant effects on the

conservation objectives of the protected area ;

c. Dedicated DNSH criteria for certain economic activities set out in the Climate

Delegated Act and Environmental Delegated Act;

i) All projects and transaction involving deforestation must be supported by

a rigorous assessment provided by the client, evaluating potential adverse

impacts on High Conservation Value 2 (HCV2) forests. These forests are

critical for maintaining essential ecosystem services and landscape-level

ecological functions. The client is responsible for submitting

comprehensive documentation that demonstrates the assessment has

been conducted in accordance with recognized environmental standards.

ii) For water compliance with EU-Directive 2006/118/EC on the protection of

groundwater against pollution and deterioration.

The potential project or transaction must comply with the relevant Policy principles and can be

determined on the basis of the assessment of the country in which the project or transaction is to be

carried out.

7 Gaming \& Gambling Sector



Erste Group has no specific business focus on the gaming industry. The exposure is maintained as

marginal part of the Erste Group portfolio. Erste Group implements this Policy to govern its business

activities in this sector as well as to service its clients and society in a responsible manner. Erste

Group recognizes that the sector provides entertainment services to society, but at the same time,

this sector is also vulnerable to the risk of losses in sensitive customer segments. Therefore, Erste

Group applies a very selective financing policy and engages only with service providers, which can

ensure best-in-class management of risks of social damages. Erste Group will engage only with

reputable and transparent companies in the European Economic Area, Erste Group Home Market or

the UK (“extended EEA”) where the gaming industry is strongly regulated and which are subject to

supervision and comply with responsible gambling principles, as well as adhere to extended EEA-wide

AML and CTF standards.

The best-in-class gaming service providers must comply with many aspects of the responsible

gaming criteria contained in a dedicated responsible gaming scorecard which provide Erste Group

with the necessary comfort for addiction prevention and addiction cure policies. Erste Group

considers lottery services, particularly state – owned lottery services, or clearly connected to

humanitarian causes – less harmful and preferable for financing activities.

The parameters described in this Policy are based on those accepted by the industry and by various

other stakeholders as representing best practice and are consistent with Erste Group’s longstanding

commitment to sustainable and socially responsible business conduct and its aim to mitigate potential

reputational and other non-financial risks.



7.1 Gaming Sector Scope

 Gaming and gambling service providers, licensed gambling industry, internet gambling

industry, sports betting, providers of hard- and software related to the gambling industry,

providers of payment processing with respect to gambling.

 Gaming and gambling services, wagering of money or something of material value on an

event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning money or material goods,

partially prohibited by national law. Includes dice games, card games, gaming machines and

lottery; the main characteristic is the random course of events.

 Gaming-related service providers, business activities which are solely or mostly related to

gaming business, operators of casinos, lotteries, sports betting, producers of gaming

software and hardware, operators and vendors of gaming machines, providers of payment

processing with respect to gambling etc.

 Payment service providers money flows – either physically or virtually represented by a set

of relevant data – to or from a client bank account held by a bank in Erste Group.

The NACE Code 9200 Gambling and Betting is typically adressing gaming-related sectors and treat

the client as gaming-related subject to this Policy.



Key risk identification

Any involvement with the business area of gaming and gambling poses risks to Erste Group, namely

through reputational risk and a wider risk to society:

 Risk of vulnerable players being prone to addiction leading to financial extorsion, social

exclusion and follow-up crime.

 Due to the large amounts of money processed by gaming-related clients potentially registered

in weakly regulated jurisdictions, the sector is prone to the risk of money laundering and other

criminal activities.

EG_A_40017 Erste Group



Date: 10/2025

Page: 28/30

Public



Group Responsible Financing Policy



 Potential illegal gaming and gambling is prone to risks of macroeconomic losses (e.g. tax

evasion).



Policy objective

Erste Group is willing to consider supporting the Gaming and Gambling sector strictly on a highly

selective basis with a clear objective to provide financing only for leisure activities. All engagements

must align with Chapter 7.2 of the financing criteria and ensure that no socially adverse risks are

assumed by the financed entities.



7.2 Financing Criteria

A detailed KYC and AML-Due Diligence process is mandatory as the first step of the on-boarding

process, in line with the Group Policy Anti-Money Laundering, Know Your Customer and Counter

Terrorist Financing.



7.2.1 Service providers/companies not eligible for new financings or any other

banking services within the Gaming and Gambling sector:

 Service providers failing to comply with the Erste Group Compliance Questionnaire;

 Service providers in any dispute with local or European law enforcement, or bodies

supervising the Gaming and Gambling sector activities that might have an impact on the

license;

 Service providers with severe controversy issues connected to gaming and gambling

activities;

 Service providers who hold client funds beyond the minimum deposit amount required for the

management of their clients;

 Services providers not complying with the minimum level of standards defined by the Erste

Group Responsible Gaming Score Card - with a special focus on addiction awareness

measures, addiction prevention measures, addiction countermeasures, underage gaming

prevention, training for staff, advertisement restrictions.

 Due diligence is to be conducted by the Deal Originator in order to obtain sufficient comfort

on the points above.

A company not scoring a minimum in Underage gambling and betting, Limits, Playing with credit and a

minimum of (83 for Lotteries, 115 for Gambling, 105 for Betting) in the Total Score, does not qualify

for a Risk Acceptance by a NFR decision.

When fulfilling a Responsible Gaming Score Card for service providers for whom, due to the nature of

the job, some questions from the Score Card cannot be answered, it is necessary to answer the

question with a best result of 3 points and put Not applicable in the comment.

If the service provider is equally engaged in all three activities (lottery / gambling / betting) based on

turnover, then it should be pragmatic and evaluate the activity through an activity that has the

strictest rules. If one activity is less than 10% of the turnover, an assessment is not required.

When fulfilling a Responsible Gaming Score Card for pure service providers such as gaming software

and hardware manufacturers, gaming machine operators and suppliers, gambling-related payment

processing service providers, etc., the "main client" for whom it provides services/products has to be

assessed.
