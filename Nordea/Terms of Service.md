1 Introduction

Nordea is committed to conduct business responsibly and to integrate environmental, social and

governance (ESG) factors into all internal processes. Our business is governed by a set of policies

and guiding documents approved by the Group Board of Directors and cascaded throughout the

organisation.



In relation to all our stakeholders, customers and other business relationships, Nordea’s Code of

Conduct1 is the central document governing our operations, together with the ESG factors outlined

in our Sustainability Policy.



Our conduct in relation to employees, workers in the value chain, communities and end users is

further supported by the following overarching documents:



• Nordea Human Rights Policy

• Nordea Diversity \& Inclusion Policy



Nordea is dedicated to adhering to all applicable rules and regulations we are obliged to follow in

the markets where we operate and we are committed to ensuring compliance with all applicable

sanctions laws and regulations globally and following the sanctions regimes of the EU, UN, US, and

the UK on a Group-wide basis, subject to applicable local laws and regulations. In addition to the

sanctions that are applied on a Group-wide basis, all Nordea entities are required to comply with

sanctions that are applicable within their jurisdiction.

Statements



Documents describing Nordea’s view and position on different sustainability

themes, taking the outset in our strategic direction and supported by our view

on the business environment where we operate and our material impacts and

risk as described in our double materiality assessment.

Value chain In the context of the Sector and Thematic framework, the value chain

consists of Nordea’s direct business relationships as defined above.

Sector guidelines Documents describing Nordea’s view on sectors identified as strategically

important from an environmental, social and governance perspective,

outlining how we address the related risks and impacts relevant for our

business relationships in these sectors.

Requirements The mandatory boundaries for Nordea’s business relationships specifying, as

relevant and applicable from a proportionality and materiality perspective,

exclusion criteria, materiality thresholds or other restrictions relating to

harmful activities in scope of each sector.

Expectations Non-binding statements outlining best practices for Nordea’s business

relationships intended to support constructive engagement dialogues,

striving for alignment with long-term risk mitigating behaviour in line with

Nordea’s strategy.



1.2 Nordea’s sustainability strategy

Nordea wants to make a difference for a greater good - not only for ourselves, but for the future and

for generations to come. We aim to provide the best possible support for customers transitioning to

a more sustainable future, and actively contribute to society to benefit the greater good. To fulfil this

aim, the Group Board has decided upon sustainability strategic priorities, integrated in the Nordea

strategy. The sector guidelines cascade and implement these strategic priorities of Nordea, where

sustainability is at the core, as requirements and expectation for specific sectors.



As a bank, we play a key role in facilitating the achievement of societies’ sustainability goals through

redirecting investments and financing towards more sustainable technologies, business models and

to businesses contributing to a just transition towards a sustainable and net-zero economy. To

Nordea, a just transition is a socially and financially inclusive transition towards sustainable and net

zero economy leaving no-one behind, and enhancing adherence to human rights.



We work closely with the stakeholders in our value chain to influence and support them in making

sustainable choices to accelerate their transition. We support companies in all stages of the

transition and strive for alignment on our long-term ambition to achieve net-zero by 2050 at the

4



latest and respect human rights. To demonstrate our ambition, Nordea has pledged adherence with

global alliances and frameworks such as:



• UN Global Compact2,

• Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI)3,

• UNEP-FI Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB)4,

• Investor Alliance for Human Rights5, and

• Equator Principles6.

• Net Zero Banking Alliance7,

• Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance8,

• Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative9



With regards to climate, Nordea is committed to become a bank with net-zero emissions by 2050 at

the latest. As part of this commitment, we have set ambitious interim targets across our own

operations, lending and investment activities, with an overarching portfolio target to reduce

emissions across lending and investment portfolios with 40-50% by 2030, compared to a 2019

baseline. In the lending portfolio, this is supported by sector-specific targets in prioritised carbon-

intensive sectors. To read more about Nordea’s sustainability targets, please visit

Nordea.com/sustainability.



2 Nordea thematic and sector framework

The thematic and sector framework is an important part of Nordea’s sustainability governance. It is

a framework consisting of thematic guidelines, position statements and sector guidelines, as further

defined under section 1.1.



The following sections are applicable only to sector guidelines. To learn more about our

sustainability governance and our sector and thematic framework, please refer to

https://www.nordea.com/en/sustainability/ and our Sustainability Policy.



2.1 Purpose

The purpose of the sector guidelines is twofold:



• to mitigate Nordea’s ESG related risks and limit the negative impacts stemming from Nordea’s

business relationships in scope of the guidelines, by setting requirements for exposure to the

most harmful activities.

• to provide guidance to our business relationships for risk mitigating behaviour in sectors

vulnerable to environmental, social or governance factors, e.g. by outlining references to best

practice standards and relevant international conventions serving to support progress.

Nordea’s sector guidelines also aim to address interdependencies and conflicts relating to different

ESG factors, such as climate change mitigation and biodiversity or climate change mitigation and

human rights, or the fact that certain sectors, such as the energy sector, are important for the

transition of other sectors in the same value chain. These interdependencies and conflicts may affect

Nordea’s position and sector outlook.



2.2 Scope

The sector guidelines cover all ESG factors that are material to Nordea according to our analysis of

the business environment and our Double Materiality Assessment and specifically address harmful

activities, key risks and impacts in the sectors most vulnerable to climate, nature and social risks.



Nordea’s sector guidelines apply to Nordea’s new and existing business relationships within the

following areas of operations, unless otherwise outlined in each sector guideline:



• Procurement

• Financing

• Investment

• Facilitation10



Requirements in scope of the sector guidelines, where sectors are defined by NACE codes, are

binding for credit exposures of EUR 1 million or more, but are to be considered for all existing

business relationships. Alternative thresholds may apply for individual sectors, as stated in each

sector guideline.



The sector guideline requirements are only relevant for Procurement, when the product or service

procured by Nordea relates to the specific industry covered in the guideline.



2.3 Implementation

The sector guidelines set out a number of requirements and expectations to support Nordea’s

progress in line with sector targets and overarching objectives, further described at

Nordea.com/sustainability.



Requirements are set to limit Nordea’s exposure to unmitigated transitional and physical climate

risks, nature related risks and impacts, and risks for human rights violations in the value chain and

communities.



Expectations are set to encourage customers, portfolio companies and suppliers to aim for best

practice and take concrete remediating actions to improve performance.



Nordea will restrict new financing, facilitation, investments and procurement activities to companies

verified to not comply with the requirements in the sector guidelines.



Existing business relationships' compliance with the requirements is verified through ongoing

activities such as screening and engagement. Controls are implemented based on a risk

proportionality approach. If an existing business relationship is found not to comply with the



10 Phased implementation during 2025-2027.

6



requirements, Nordea will engage in a dialogue to ensure concrete remediating actions are initiated.

If non-compliance persists, preparation for an orderly exit may be considered as an ultimate resort.



Exemptions to sector guideline requirements may be applied to existing business relationships as

long as the exposure does not prevent Nordea from reaching its overarching objectives and sector

targets and is not in conflict with other applicable regulation for Nordea nor for the business

relationship. Exemptions for business relationships are granted by Nordea’s Sustainability and Ethics

committee after careful consideration of the ESG related risks and benefits associated with the

business relationship11. Process for exemptions for business relationships in subsidiaries are further

described in local governance documents.



2.4 Due diligence and sanctions controls

In addition to the controls related to the requirements of the sector guidelines, Nordea has an

onboarding and periodic review process designed to help identify and mitigate Financial Crime,

including sanctions risks. This process includes the application of an enhanced due diligence (EDD)

for customers and other business relationships deemed to carry higher risk or being active in an

industry with a higher inherent risk. For further reading, please see Nordea.com for Nordea

Sanctions Risk Management Policy Statement12 and Nordea AML/CTF/ATE Policy Statement13.



Nordea recognizes the significance of and challenges associated with respecting human rights and

mitigating environmental impacts. In order to address these challenges, and enable mitigation of

potential adverse impacts from our business operations, we are adhering to the human rights due

diligence process as defined by the UN Guiding Principles on Business Human Rights and the due

diligence requirements outlined in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). This

includes identifying and assessing potential adverse human rights impacts in our value chain and

taking measures to address them.



3 General expectations

The principles in Nordea’s Code of Conduct guide the daily work and our business decisions. We

take them and all other relevant environmental, social and governance aspects into consideration

when evaluating business impacts, risks and opportunities. We also expect our business

relationships to align with these principles. Reflecting our own ambition, we expect all business

relationships in scope of the guidelines to:



• have a Code of Conduct and compliance function in place, a Supplier Code of Conduct and

include clauses on compliance with ESG criteria in their contracts with subcontractors and

suppliers, ensuring ethical business practices including whistle blower and grievance

mechanisms

• analyse and report material sustainability matters in line with established standards, such as the

Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) (applied to EU companies from Jan 1st 2024

and onwards), as applicable.



11 For credit, the escalation goes first to the executive credit committee, as per the internal credit process.

• support a just and orderly transition to a low-carbon economy when engaging with policy

makers and refrain from participating in any direct or indirect advocacy activities aimed at

weakening climate policy

• have environment, health, and safety (EHS) management systems that meet standards such as

the ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 where relevant



Commitment to the following international conventions and standards is encouraged for all

Nordea’s business relationships in line with our own ambitions and commitments:



• The United Nations Global Compact14,

• The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights15.

• OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises16,

• The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals17,

• Paris Agreement on climate change18,

• Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework19



Nordea’s business relationships are expected to identify, assess and manage their ESG related

impacts, risks and opportunities and to develop transition plans to support their progress. Nordea

expects all business relationships to be open to engagement and constructive dialogue on the

contents of the transition plan, with the ambition to align targets and actions with the Paris

Agreement and other applicable international goals on sustainability. Nordea engages with

customers across sectors to decrease dependency on fossil fuels through energy efficiency

measures and increased use of low carbon energy sources.



4 Global outlook for fossil fuels

Fossil fuels – defined as coal, oil, natural gas and peat – have played a pivotal role in driving

industrial growth and economic prosperity world-wide. In 2023 fossil fuels represented app 80% of

the world’s energy mix20 and 40%21 of the Nordic energy consumption. It is used e.g. in construction,

electricity generation for industry, to heat and light homes and offices, to produce medical supplies,

computers and digital devices, metals, plastics and agricultural products and to propel cars, trucks,

ships and aircraft.



The IPCC concludes that society needs to transition to significantly less primary energy from fossil

coal, oil as well as gas already by 2030. Decarbonizing of power production and distribution is

essential for the transition to a low carbon society. Combustion of fossil fuels is the largest man-

made source of greenhouse gases, of which burning of thermal coal is the single largest contributor,

accounting for one third of the 1°C average temperature rise already observed. Thus, thermal coal

phase out is the most urgent fossil fuel-related emissions driver22 to address and it is specifically part

of the global climate agreement agreed by all countries at COP26 in Glasgow 2021. At COP28 two

years later in Dubai it was agreed to transition away from all fossil fuels.



The EU has adopted a long-term strategy to become an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas

emissions by 2050. The objective is at the heart of the European Green Deal and the step-by-step

transition beyond the combustion of fossil coal, oil and gas in the EU and Nordic region. The EU and

most of the Nordic countries, also have intermediate climate and energy targets in legislation for

2030 and sector by sector decarbonisation roadmaps23 which all result in lowered fossil fuel

dependencies.



There is a stark contrast between demand and supply curves for oil and gas in scenarios based on

current policies and what is required in scenarios limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. In its

stated policy scenario, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that both oil and gas

demand increase slightly by 2030 relative to 2023, with significant regional divergence. Advanced

economies generally see demand declines and emerging and developing economies are estimated

to see growing demand. In Europe, oil demand is estimated to decline with 12% by 2030 and gas

demand with 9% in the current policy scenario. The estimated demand declines in this scenario are

not sufficient to meet the 1.5°C goal, which would require more transformative and significantly

accelerated action from all parts of society with coordinated actions on both demand and supply

side.



Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and the second largest contributor to global warming. The

oil and gas industry is one of the largest sources of anthropogenic methane emissions, and is the

sector with the greatest potential for methane emissions reduction. In 2021 alone, the global oil and

gas industry wasted $19 billion of natural gas due to methane emissions24.



For the world to reach net-zero by 2050, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is necessary to remove

and permanently store CO2 from point sources and from the atmosphere. The oil and gas sector is

central in prospecting and developing geological storage sites for CO2 and in establishing well-

functioning value chains for CCS. The CCS market is expected to be regional since a shorter

distance from source to storage is key to managing operating expenses. The demand for carbon

storage in Europe is expected to rapidly increase when carbon taxes increase, the EU ETS allowance

system becomes more ambitious and high permanence emission removals are phased in.



5 Nordea position

Nordea recognises the responsibility to work towards a just transition to a net-zero economy and to

a sustainable society.



As the largest bank in the Nordics with extensive presence in all Nordic countries, Nordea’s business

and lending activities reflect, to varying extent, the economic activity and sectoral composition in

each of its home markets. In Norway, oil and gas have been a vital part of the economic

development, accounting for more than 60% of its total value of exported goods in 202325, and will

continue to play a role in the transition to a low-carbon future while also contributing to energy

security in Europe.



Nordea’s strategy in the fossil fuel based industries is to identify performance leaders with robust

net-zero aligned transition plans and support them in close dialogue. In instances when a transition

plan is in place but not Paris aligned we aim to engage in dialogue to strengthen it.



Nordea’s sector targets for the lending portfolio in this sector are the following:



• Reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 financed emissions from oil and gas Exploration and

Production by 55% from 2019 to 2030.

• Full exit from thermal coal in 2021

• Full exit from offshore in 2025

• Full exit from thermal peat in 202526



Nordea believes that active engagement is the most effective strategy to achieve real-economy

impact through the operations of our customers and investees. To this end, we have set the

following targets:



• Ensuring that, by the end of 2025, 80% of the top 200 emitters in Nordea Asset Management’s

portfolios are either aligned with the Paris Agreement or are subject to active engagement to

become aligned by the end of 2024.

• Ensuring that, by the end of 2025, 90% of our lending exposure to large corporate customers in

the fossil fuel-based sector shall be covered by transition plans.



For capital markets facilitation, Nordea adheres to the updated target setting guidelines issued by

the Net Zero Banking Alliance and will consider the inclusion of targets for capital market activities

and facilitated emissions as part of the review process of existing financed emissions targets.



I relation to the wider Arctic region north of the Arctic Circle, Nordea’s priority is to assess and

promote sound management of biodiversity and ecosystem risks. We recognize that such risks are

especially severe in offshore locations enclosed by the southernmost extent of winter sea ice.

35 With the exception of potential energy security measures in Finland after the publication this guideline

13



We expect all business relationships to work with peers to control their methane emissions and

improve the accuracy and transparency of methane emissions reporting in the oil and gas sector.



We expect companies to recognise the critical role of environmental conservation in their planning

and operational management. They should lead by developing best practices, commit to relevant

standards and conventions that prioritise sustainability and integrate this in their management

planning and decision processes. This includes adopting strategies to reduce carbon emissions,

enhance energy efficiency and engage in biodiversity conservation efforts, thereby ensuring a

responsible and proactive approach to environmental stewardship. This includes, but is not limited

to, adherence to the following standards:



• UN Global Compact

• Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl

Habitat (RAMSAR)

• the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI)

• the OSPAR Convention

• the Oil \& Gas Methane Partnership 2.0, or OGCI methane initiative, and to commit to end all

routine and non-emergency flaring and venting operations no later than 2030.

• the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation

(OPRC)
