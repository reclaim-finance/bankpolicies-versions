1/Purpose and scope



Purpose



The Responsible Investment Policy (the “Policy”)describes the framework governing the approach ofNordea Asset Management (“NAM”) to responsibleinvestments. NAM has two ESG focusedcommittees with specific areas of responsibility:

• The Responsible Investment Committee(“RIC”) decides and monitors exclusions andengagements at investment level.

• The ESG Committee secures the governanceof our ESG related methods and principles.An ESG Operational Forum facilitatesdiscussions and secures alignment andcoordination on ESG matters across theNAM value chain, ensuring that the relevantdecisions are brought to the ESG Committeefor approval. The ESG Committee is alsoresponsible for the content of and adherenceto this Policy.

Both Committees include members from the SeniorExecutive Management team and are chaired bythe head of NAM, who is also the CEO of NordeaAsset Management Holding AB.

Nordea Asset Management’s mission is to createreturns with responsibility by

• being ESG-proactive• delivering excess returns• offering access to the right assets• demonstrating operational excellence andtransparency• maintaining industry-leading risk andperformance management

By ESG-proactive we mean

• integrating environmental, social and governancefactors into our investment processes, taking intoaccount both sides of the “double materiality”1• actively engaging with our investee companiesto ensure that they meet our expectations ofsound ESG performance and compliance withinternational norms• offering a wide range of ESG solutions across allasset classes• accepting the responsibility to act as an industryleader within ESG/sustainability



Scope



NAM, or NAM Holding, which is the assetmanagement subsidiary of Nordea Bank Abp,includes Nordea Investment Management AB(“NIM”) and Nordea Investment Funds S.A.(“NIFSA”). NIM is a Swedish investment firmauthorised to, inter alia, provide discretionaryportfolio management services, and NIFSAis a management company authorised by the CSSF(the Luxembourg FSA) to manage UCITSand alternative investment funds. Nordea Funds Ltd(“NF”), is a management company authorisedby the Finnish FSA.

This Policy applies to all our Nordea-brandedinvestment strategies, including all the active andpassive investment funds managed by NIFSA and NF.

The Policy does not apply to selected discretionarymandates where the client has opted out of thePolicy.

Due to the nature of certain investments, such asderivatives and units in external funds, the Policymay also not apply to a limited type of underlyinginvestment, whilst applying at the level of theportfolio.

This Policy is reviewed and updated as requiredand at least annually.

1 The concept of double materiality refers to, on the one hand, those ESG/sustainability risks that are material to the financial perfor-mance of an investee company or other entity, and, on the other, to the environmental and social impact of the activities of the samecompany or entity. The two will typically be closely linked, but should not be conflated.

2/Advocacyand memberships



In 2019, NAM publicly committed to aligning ourinvestment strategies with the objectives of theParis Agreement. This means that we have a long-term strategic objective to reduce the greenhousegas emissions impact of our investments in linewith the “well below 2°C” ambition, increase ourinvestments based on climate-related opportunitiesand ensure that our investment portfolios areresilient to climate-related risks. Since 2020, we area founding member of the Net Zero Asset Managersinitiative.

Our Responsible Investment Policy aims to encour-age the companies we invest in to support theUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals(“SDGs”) and comply with international conventionsand norms, including, but not limited to:

• United Nations Global Compact• OECD Principles of Corporate Governance• OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises• Universal Declaration of Human Rights• UN Guiding Principles on Business andHuman Rights• Children’s Rights and Business Principles• ILO conventions on labour standards• Rio Declaration on Environment andDevelopment• UN Convention on Corruption• Convention on Cluster Munitions

We support standardised and integrated reporting,which incorporates material sustainability informa-tion with financial information and provides consist-ent and comparable ESG data, preferably using theSASB framework or similar. We also support andpromote the adoption of the recommendations of theTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures(“TCFD”).

In this context, we actively engage with variousstandard-setters and stakeholders locally andinternationally. We are active members of the PRI,SASB, IIGCC, CDP, TPI, Finance for BiodiversityPledge and Investor Alliance for Human Rights.

Nordea Asset Management adheres to the ESG4Realstandard for a select number of funds and complieswith the certification criteria through the integrationof exclusion, norm-based screening and activeownership into the investment process.



NAM became a signatory to the Principles for ResponsibleInvestments (the “PRI”) in 2007 and has offered strategieswith sectoral screening since 1988.

NAM ́s responsible investment frame-work builds on the PRI. We strive toachieve ESG integration spanning arange of products through five mainmechanisms:

• norm-based screening• sustainability risk integration• NAM-level PAI consideration• NAM-level exclusion list• active ownership and engagement

NAM has developed policies andprocedures to ensure that thecompanies we invest in meet ourexpectations of ESG performance andthat ESG/sustainability risk is managedin our investment processes. This issupported by a robust norm-basedscreening process and principal adverseimpact (“PAI”) 2 analysis. In addition,we consider and take a stance on anongoing basis, across our portfolios,on issues relating to climate change,human rights, good governance andbiodiversity/water. All of the aboveinform our active ownership andengagement policy and our exclusionlist at the firm level – our “firm-leveloverlay”.

For a substantial part of our assetsunder management, we aim to achievedeeper ESG integration with handson involvement of the ResponsibleInvestment team in our STARSstrategies and thematic strategies

(including climate, social empowermentand gender diversity portfolios) andour internally developed ESG scoringof investee companies. Many individualproducts also have sector-based orother exclusion criteria beyond thoseimplemented at the firm level. Giventhe size of NAM’s investment universeacross its various investment boutiquesand strategies, we use a range ofexternal providers of ESG data as wellas internal research and our proprietaryESG scoring platform. These dataproviders and other data sources areassessed on an ongoing basis for dataquality, coverage and other attributes.

As for all ESG-oriented asset managersand asset owners, the dilemma ofchoosing between engagement andexclusion is central for NAM. Theargument for exclusion rests on theneed to clearly mark the limits of whichcorporate activity and/or behavioursare deemed acceptable and which arenot. The argument for engagement,on the other hand, recognises that thereal-world effect of exclusion can benegligible, at least in the short term.Whenever one market participant sellsoff a security, another, presumablywith lower standards of propriety, isbuying it. Thus, it can be argued thatretaining a security, engaging with thecompany and – where applicable –voting at its AGMs, is more effective.Added complexity is introduced by

We believe that it is our fiduciary duty to deliver returnswith responsibility.



the likelihood that exclusion by someinvestors may make a company withsubstandard practices more open to theengagement efforts of the remainingowners and thus to improving itspractices over a longer timeframe.

At NAM we believe that there areactivities and types of behaviour thatcannot be reconciled with our missionof delivering returns with responsibility.Companies exhibiting these on anongoing basis are excluded from ourinvestment universe. There is a largecategory of economic activities whichon the one hand may contributepositively to one or more SDG, whilepotentially having a negative impacton others. Activities and companies inthis category are excluded from manyNordea-branded investment strategies

(see below for NAM’s strategy-specificapproaches and our Paris-aligned FossilFuel Policy), while still being investiblefor more traditional strategies.

Assuming that engagement is mosteffective when it is supported by animplicit but clearly understood threatof ultimate exclusion, we believe thatthis allows NAM to be more compellingin its engagement, up to the pointwhere the decision is taken to exclude acompany at the NAM firm-level.

2 Principal adverse impact on entity-level is re-ported annually in accordance with the EU SFDR.Principal adverse impact indicators, as defined bythe EU SFDR, capture the environmental and so-cial or “outward” part of the “double materiality”,as opposed to sustainability risk, which capturesthe financial materiality of ESG issuesto the valuation of a security.



3/Our responsibleinvestment approach

10 11



3.1 NAM-level overlay



NAM ́s responsible investmentframework comprises the availabilityof ESG data to all portfolio managersas well as a baseline integration ofESG safeguards, such as norm-basedscreening, PAI consideration anda common exclusion list, governedby our Responsible InvestmentCommittee and implemented acrossour Nordea-branded investmentstrategies. In addition, all NAM’sinternal investment boutiques take intoaccount sustainability risk as part oftheir portfolio management processes.The decisions taken in the RIC ensurethat our Nordea-branded investmentstrategies live up to NAM’s minimumESG requirements, independent ofthe individual strategies’ specific ESGprofiles.



3.1.1 Norm-based screening

Our Nordea-branded investmentstrategies are subject to norm-basedscreening, which identifies companiesthat are allegedly involved in breachesof international law and norms onenvironmental protection, human rights,labour standards and anti-corruption. Ifa company is identified in this screeningprocess, an internal assessment of thecompany and the incident is initiated.The assessment is conducted by theResponsible Investment team, whichprovides a recommendation to the RIC,upon which the RIC decides on actionsto be taken. Typical actions includeengagement, quarantine or exclusion.A quarantine implies that the holdingsof NAM portfolios in the companyconcerned may not be increased anda quarantine will in nearly all cases beaccompanied by direct engagementwith the company. The RIC may also

conclude that the issue raised does notmerit immediate action, either becauseit has already been resolved or it isjudged to be minor/immaterial.



3.1.2 NAM-level PAI consideration

The environmental and social impact ofthe activities of our investee companiesis monitored on an ongoing basis,subject to data availability, usingan internally-developed monitoringsystem. Companies identifiedas outliers on one or more PAIindicators are analysed further by theResponsible Investment team and arecommendation for action is made tothe RIC, in a process similar to the onedescribed above for norm breaches.Additional PAI consideration can takeplace at the individual investmentstrategy level. Our disclosure statementon the consideration of principaladverse impact at entity-level can befound on our websites. The principaladverse impact of our investments isreported annually in this statement.



3.1.3 NAM-level exclusion list

Recognising that some types ofeconomic activity or corporatebehaviour are not compatible with ourmission of returns with responsibility,NAM maintains a firm-level exclusionlist that is applied in accordance withthe scope of this Policy. Any additionto – or removal from – the list isdecided by the RIC.



NAM excludes companies involved in seriousbreaches of international norms whereengagement is deemed not to be possible oreffective, as discussed above. For example, we baninvestment in companies active in the productionof controversial weapons, including – but notlimited to – cluster munitions and anti-personnelmines as well as nuclear weapons. NAM excludescompanies involved in production or distributionof pornography and companies involved inthe production of tobacco with a 5% revenuethreshold. NAM also does not invest in companiesderiving more than 5% of their revenues fromthermal coal, and has additional investmentrestrictions for power generation companieswithout coal phase out plans, or with coal powerexpansion activity. In addition, NAM excludescompanies involved in the production of fossilfuels from oil sands (5% revenue threshold) orthrough arctic drilling. A substantial and growingpart of our strategies is also subject to our Paris-aligned Fossil Fuel Policy (“PAFF”), which excludescompanies involved in fossil fuel production,distribution or services if they do not have arecognised strategy to achieve an emissions paththat is consistent with the Paris Agreement’s goal 3 .

For strategies where the PAFF is not implementedas a hard exclusion criterion, the PAFF acts asguidance for engagement. The PAFF criteria alsoinform the prioritisation of our top-down thematicengagements.

3.1.4 Active ownership and engagement

On behalf of our clients, we undertake a range ofengagement activities with investee companiesin order to encourage them to improve theirenvironmental, social and governance practices,including promoting a long-term approach to



Thematic engagements may be undertakeneither by NAM alone or in collaboration with otherasset managers and asset owners. Collaborativeengagements can take place within the frameworkof industry initiatives such as Climate Action 100+,SASB, PRI, CDP or the Investor Alliance for HumanRights or through ad hoc initiatives. NAM will insome cases initiate and lead such ad hoc investoralliances. NAM’s thematic engagements typicallyconcern issues under one of the core areas ofinterest identified in NAM’s ESG approach:

• climate• human rights• good governance• biodiversity/water



Investment-led engagements are initiated andexecuted at the individual strategy and investmentboutique level.



Norms engagements are triggered by observednorm breaches, PAI red flags or other seriousnegative news flows.

In tandem with our direct engagement withcompanies, voting is undertaken at as many AGMsas practically possible, prioritising votes related tothe four core areas listed above, while in generalinsisting that companies 1) act in the long-terminterest of shareholders, 2) safeguard the rightsof all shareholders, 3) ensure an efficient andindependent board structure, 4) align incentivestructures for employees with the long-term interestof shareholders, 5) disclose information to the publicin a timely, accurate and adequate manner and6) ensure high social, environmental and ethicalstandards and accountability.

For more information, please refer to the NIMEngagement Policy, the NIFSA CorporateGovernance Principles, and the NF CorporateGovernance Principles.

The quality of the engagement process is auditedby internal audit on a regular basis. NAM complies

with a number of national and supra-nationalcorporate governance codes.



Political engagement \- we may participate inactivities that can be considered as politicalengagement, such as providing feedback onregulations and expressing support to policy makersthrough public endorsement in investor statements.We may also conduct policy engagement, whichare activities focused on public policy dialogueswith governments as well as public authorities onspecific ESG issues. These activities align with ourcore values and our strategy to deliver returns withresponsibility.

These type of activities are subject to carefulconsideration and diligence. We always assessthe appropriateness of an activity that could beconsidered as political, before we decide to enter intoit, and always assess the potential impact of suchactivity. Our activities focus solely on ESG issues, anddo not intend to favour any specific political partyor ideology4. We believe that our participation inpolitical activities can contribute to long-term valuecreation and have a positive impact on society.



3.1.5 How we integrate ESG

NAM has implemented several initiatives to supportESG integration throughout the whole firm. Ourinvestment boutiques have access to NAM’sproprietary ESG database and ESG analysis fromthe Responsible Investment team, as well as ESGdata from external data providers. NAM’s Risk \&Performance team has integrated information onportfolio ESG/sustainability risks in their daily reportto the analysts and portfolio managers.

The Responsible Investment team conducts work-shops on ESG topics and provides walkthroughs ofdevelopments, where different use-case-scenariosof the data are presented.

3.1.6 EscalationWhich tools are at our disposal?

Collaborative Engagement

We believe that joining forces with other investorsin engaging with companies is an effective way toachieve successful engagement outcomes. Whilewe also engage individually, we see collaborativeengagements as an important part of our ActiveOwnership work. Engaging in this way allows us toshare views with other industry players, and to scaleup the impact of our engagements.



Stakeholder Engagement

Interacting or partnering with other stakeholderssuch as trade or industry organizations, NGOs,experts, standard setters and regulatory bodies canbe an efficient means of escalating an engagement.



Media and Events

Using different media channels, organizing webinarsand conferences to further engagements withcompanies or industries are another method toescalate engagements and raise awareness.



Public Statements

We may individually or jointly with other investorsor organizations issue public statements to highlightour position on a key ESG topic, our differing viewsor our expectations on best practices and conduct.



Letters to CEO or Board of Directors

To make our voice heard at the highest levels in acompany and to underline our expectations on keyissues, we may send letters to either the CEO, theBoard Chair, Independent Directors, or to individualmembers of the Board, such as those chairingspecific committees, either individually or togetherwith other investors. These letters can be open orsubmitted in confidence.



Annual General Meetings

At AGMs, we can use our voting rights as well asthe overall meeting to influence the company,escalate an engagement or lay out our support foror opposition to specific issues and votable items.

Proxy Voting: We aim to vote at all companies weare invested in and in order to do so we attendAGMs and use proxy voting. At the AGM we canuse our voting rights and power to support orvote against directors, items and shareholder andmanagement proposals. We can thus use ourvoting rights and power to influence companieson certain matters and to support and escalate ourengagements.

AGM Communication: In addition to voting, wecan ask questions, express concerns or readout statements (during the Q\&A or submittedbeforehand).

Pre-AGM Meetings: At pre-AGM meetings initiatedby us or the company, we can discuss certainitems on the ballot related to an engagement anddiscuss our voting intention and rationale withthe company. These meetings allow us to furtherhighlight our position on key issues and why wemay be inclined to vote against managementitems or for specific shareholder resolutions.

(Co-)filing of Shareholder Resolutions: We mayfile or co-file shareholder resolutions with otherinvestors to put an expected change of behavioror disclosure up for vote at a company’s AGM.

To gather support for a shareholder proposalwhich we have co-filed, we can initiate investorcampaigns and/or file exempt solicitations.

Pre-declaration of voting intentions: We can alsopre-declare our voting intentions, for example viathe PRI voting platform, our own homepage or viaother channels.



Quarantine

We may quarantine a company, meaning portfoliomanagers cannot increase their position, for allNAM funds or for a subset (for example in theSTARS, Responsible and Thematic ranges) should acontroversy arise related to the company.

The quarantine will be kept in place until we havereasonable grounds that the company is addressingor remediating the issue. Should this not happen, wemay ultimately exclude the company.



Exclusion

In cases of serious breaches of international normson environmental protection, human rights, laborstandards, anti-corruption, or other norms, we mayinitiate an internal assessment of the company andthe incident, with the ultimate outcome potentiallybeing exclusion across all Nordea funds.

De facto exclusions may also be applied only forspecific types of funds, for example our STARS,Responsible and Thematic ranges.

Our Escalation Process – Norms Engagements

While all engagements may be escalated, we followa clear, time-bound and delineated process for our‘RIC Norms’ engagements. These engagementstake place with companies that are alleged to bein breach of international norms or conventions orthose involved in significant ESG-related incidents.

Using our data providers, we screen our investmentportfolio for companies which are alleged to be inbreach of international norms or conventions. Shoulda possible breach be detected, our ResponsibleInvestments team assesses the case based on factorssuch as severity, magnitude of impact, as well as thecompany’s degree of involvement and culpability.This assessment is presented to our ResponsibleInvestments Committee (RIC), which is chaired byNordea Asset Management’s CEO and convenes on aquarterly basis.

Following the presentation of the case to RIC, thecommittee may decide that a direct exclusion iswarranted or that the Responsible Investments teamshould initiate an engagement related to the breach

to acquire further information and/or a commitmentto remediation. If the matter is deemed by RIC to beinconsequential, the committee may also decide totake no further action.

If RIC decides that an engagement should beinitiated, we follow a clear process, with time-boundmilestones that must be met. Depending on theseverity of the case, the response or responsivenessof the company, as well as additional information wereceive during the engagement, we may decide tomake use of the additional escalation tools describedin 3.16, quarantine or exclude the company.

Following the decision to engage, we contact thecompany highlighting the alleged breach, andrequesting a meeting with representatives of thecompany. We also highlight that an unsatisfactoryconclusion of the engagement case may ultimatelylead to an exclusion from NAMs portfolios.

Should the company not respond, we follow upin regular increments. If the company remainsunresponsive or there is no positive progress on the

case around the 9 month mark, we will begin using“lower” strength escalation tools, as described inthe escalation toolbox (please see 3.1.6. for furtherelaboration of the tools at our disposal).

If we cannot achieve positive momentum in ourengagement through the “lower” strength escalationtools, we will consider “higher” strength tools aswell as present the case to RIC for re-assessment.Ultimately, should these tools not yield our expectedchange and positive progress, the escalation trackmay lead to an exclusion from NAMs portfolios.

After 18 to 24 months we aim to have receivedclear communication by the company detailing itsapproach to remediation or meeting the objectiveswe have set for the engagement. Finally, we continueto monitor the case, the company’s conduct and anynew information that arises before presenting a finalevaluation of the case and engagement to RIC.

Following the three years of engagement, we expectthat a company has made meaningful progresstowards our objectives which align with remedying

the breach, strengthening processes and proceduresto prevent reoccurrence etc. We may continue theengagement on a “lower” intensity to continuouslymonitor progress in complex cases, where forexample litigation or longer drawn-out remediationmay impact the process.

While this process details the steps we take,individual engagements may have differenttimelines on a case-by-case basis giventhe complexities and differences betweenengagements, the specific severity of impacts andthe requirements for a positive outcome.

Furthermore, depending on our relationship withthe company, the conduciveness and accessibilityof different escalatory steps, and our degree ofconfidence in the company’s bona fide intentions,the ultimate use of each element of the escalationtoolbox will be tailored on a case-by-case basis.

3.2 Investment strategies



For a substantial part of our Nordea-branded invest-ment strategies, the application of ESG tools goesbeyond the requirements of the firm-level policiesdescribed above. These strategies are specificallymade available to clients as products promoted withESG characteristics or, where appropriate, as sustain-able investment products as defined by the SFDR.

For specific information on which additional ESGfeatures are integrated in the investment decisionsof a specific strategy, please refer to our product-specific disclosures.



3.2.1 The STARS strategies: proven leadershipwithin responsible investment

Our STARS product range, which was launchedwith the Swedish Stars Equity strategy in 2010 andEmerging Stars Equity strategy in 2011, today coversa wide variety of asset classes. The STARS rangefeatures deeper ESG integration and offers direct,hands on cooperation between portfolio managersand the Responsible Investment team. Using NAM’sproprietary ESG scoring system and bespokeanalysis carried out by the Responsible Investmentteam and financial analysts, the STARS portfoliosaim to outperform standard benchmarks. Throughproduct-specific, investment-led engagementwith investee companies, the portfolio managersand the Responsible Investment team proactivelyleverage NAM’s entire asset base to attempt tocreate positive ESG impact, while seeking improvedvaluation and excess return. More broadly, theinvestment teams behind the STARS strategiesfocus on selecting companies not only with soundfundamentals, but also with high ESG scores. Usingthe SASB materiality map, the company analysisincludes enhanced due diligence on environmental,social and governance risks material to the investeecompany and considers how companies managethe identified ESG risks.

Furthermore, each company’s business model align-ment with the UN SDGs is taken into consideration

as the strategies’ exposure aims to skew towardscompanies whose activities are net supportive orneutral, rather than detracting, with respect to theSDGs. ESG scores are recalibrated regularly and atleast annually or when triggered by relevant nega-tive or positive engagement results or news flows.

In addition to the positive selection described above,the STARS strategies are also subject to a numberof formal exclusion criteria (see here) and adhere tothe PAFF. These will, rarely – if ever – be triggeredas companies subject to exclusion would typicallynot be identified as investible in the first place.

Investment-led engagement is a key and distinctivepart of our investment approach for the STARSstrategies. Portfolio managers and the ResponsibleInvestment team engage proactively with compa-nies in the STARS portfolios when we see materialESG risks that may not be adequately managed, oropportunities that may not be fully capitalised on.We may also engage with them to advance certainthemes related to the SDGs. Our engagementactivities in the STARS strategies are detailed inquarterly reports available to our clients.



3.2.2 NAM’s thematic ESG strategies

Besides the STARS strategies, which invest acrossa broad range of companies within their givenasset class, NAM offers a series of thematic ESGstrategies. These range from the seminal GlobalClimate and Environment strategy launched in 2008,to the Global Gender Diversity strategy launched in2019 and the Global Social Empowerment strategylaunched in 2021.

NAM’s thematic ESG strategies apply proprietarymethods to identify companies that can be expectedto contribute to, or benefit from, the ESG themein question. Often, in-depth research will revealpotential investee companies with activities in areasthat are not intuitively associated with the theme ofthe strategy. For example, the holdings of the NAMclimate strategy cover far broader ground thanjust the traditional renewable energy industry and

related sectors usually associated with combatingor adapting to climate change. As is the case forthe STARS strategies, our thematic ESG strategiesbenefit from hands on involvement from theResponsible Investment team and are subject to anenhanced ESG exclusion regime, including the PAFF.



3.2.3 Enhanced exclusion filters

We understand that while many of our clientsmay not choose to invest in a STARS or thematicstrategy, they may not wish to be exposed tocertain companies, sectors or practices, evenwhere there may be potential for improving thesecompanies’ behaviour through engagement and/or the scope for asset allocation in a portfolio ismaterially limited. For this purpose, many of ourother investment strategies, including our multi-asset strategies, are available with specific exclusionfilters, including the NAM Paris-Aligned Fossil FuelPolicy, the so-called “NBIM list” of the NorwegianGovernment Pension Fund Global and ethical filterstargeting sectors such as tobacco, alcohol, gamingor pornography. In addition, some strategies alsofeature targets for or limits on the carbon footprint/intensity relative to benchmark, a targeted minimumESG score, or a targeted level of EU taxonomyalignment.

4/Investment Restrictions



5 Subject to data availability.

6 The threshold on metallurgical coal is higher as there are currently no widely available alternatives. Nevertheless, NAM has chosen toapply a threshold and expects to adjust it downwards as applicable coal-free technologies appear, eg in the area of steel production.

7 A coal phase out commitment encompasses a public commitment to ending production of thermal coal or coalfired electricity gener-ation by 2040 latest.

8 Advanced economies are defined by IEA as the OECD regional grouping plus Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta and Romania.

9 Expansion plans includes projects that are announced, pre-permitted, permitted or under construction and which will result in newcoal-fired power capacity of at least 100 MW prorated.

10 Palm oil producers are defined as having \>10% revenue threshold from palm oil.

11 RSPO: Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.

These restrictions are continuously monitored in our internal limit monitoring system.5 Pre-trade limits blockthe unfit investment opportunities and post-trade limits flag exposure or activity that is not aligned withthe investment restrictions, which may ultimately lead to divestment. Additional exclusions may apply forcertain investment strategies.

NAM considers a range of weapon types, and their potential use, to be contro-versial, given their indiscriminate effect on human populations. NAM does notinvest in companies that are involved in the production or development of clustermunitions, anti-personnel mines, biological weapons, chemical weapons, weaponswith non-detectable fragments, incendiary and blinding laser weapons as well asdepleted uranium munitions.

NAM does not invest in companies that are verified to be directly involved in produc-tion or development of nuclear weapons. NAM also excludes companies involved inthe maintenance of nuclear weapons, with a military revenue threshold of 5%.

Since 2012, NAM has not offered investment products where basic food commodi-ties such as wheat, coffee or sugar are included in the underlying assets.

We take part in collaborative engagements, join investor initiatives and conduct research to, on a best effortbasis, ensure that our investee companies work towards living up to these positions. Depending on the natureand gravity of individual cases, breaches can trigger engagement or exclusion.



Climate change

Climate change is one of the single largest threats to the global economy and in general to the conditions of all life on earth.

In addition, it implies specific risks to the companies and other entities we invest in. NAM is working on an ongoing basis to assessclimate change risks and the impact of the low-carbon transition on sectors and companies. Climate change presents a challenge toour investments – in terms of its physical impact as well as through the prospect of radical policy measures and changing consumerbehaviour with the aim of reducing GHG emissions globally (transition risk). We expect companies exposed to climate risk:

• to have a strong climate governance and demonstrate how they integrate climate change challenges into their business strategies,investment decisions and risk management• to be able to disclose how their long-term business strategy and profitability will be impacted by a different regulatory andphysical environment• to show how they identify and capitalise on opportunities related to climate change• to be transparent with regards to their position on climate change regulation and interaction with regulators and policy makers• to report in line with TCFD recommendations and act to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across their value chains inaccordance with the Paris Agreement



5/ESG positions



Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, having contributed to around 30% of global warming since the industrialrevolution.12 As methane is a short-term climate forcer, 80 times more potent than CO2 over 20 years, reducing itprovides critical short-term mitigation benefits and is a cost-effective mitigation strategy for the oil and gas (O\&G)sector.13

We expect companies active in the O\&G sector to map methane mitigation actions, share their cost/benefit anal-ysis of these as well as ultimately achieve near-zero methane emissions as backed by the Oil and Gas MethanePartnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) Gold Standard reporting.14



Methane

Human Rights

While protecting and fulfilling human rights is a legal obligation and the responsibility of governments, it is widely recognised that allbusinesses have the potential to impact human rights. Poor management conflicts with the long-term interest in promoting a responsi-ble and sustainable development and may impact companies’ license to operate.

Business operations in areas affected by conflict are exposed to higher risk due to unstable political condi-tions, weak regulatory frameworks and pervasive violence. Companies may, knowingly or unknowingly, havebusiness operations and products with a high potential impact on the conflict or human rights violations.

As a responsible investor we expect companies to conduct due diligence as defined by the UN GuidingPrinciples on Business Human Rights, become more transparent and report on their political risk and impactanalysis, including their human rights impact. Companies also need to assess and report on how their businessoperations or products may directly or indirectly impact an ongoing conflict or human rights violation and howthis may have a material impact on the company as well as its stakeholders. Companies should also enablestakeholders to safely report any human rights violations.

We expect companies to respect Indigenous Peoples’ rights, as recognized by international principles such asthe UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including by applying the principle of Free, Prior andInformed Consent (FPIC) for activities that may impact them.

According to the definition by the UN, free implies that there is no coercion, intimidation or manipulation, prior

implies that consent is sought sufficiently in advance with respect shown to time requirements and informed

implies that information covers a range of aspects including nature, size, reversibility amongst others, of anyproject and/or activity.15

India’s pharmaceutical industry, expected to grow to USD 130 billion by 203016, contributes to the country’s se-vere water pollution crisis caused by the waste generated in the manufacturing process. Pharmaceutical pollu-tion also drives antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is expected to cost USD 100 trillion 17 and kill 10 million18people by 2050. AMR has been declared one of the top ten global threats to human health and is a systemicrisk that may impact investment portfolios, economic stability and broader society. Without access to effectiveantimicrobials, public health and the foundation of modern medicine is being undermined.

We expect investee companies in the health care sector and pharmaceutical industry to make efforts to safe-guard public health. This includes actions to adequately address pollution as well as AMR.

The green transition and decarbonisation of the global economy relies on climate justice, balancing economic,environmental and social factors and finding solutions for workers and communities. In this context, a justtransition refers to preserving human rights and mitigating adverse societal and environmental impacts in thetransition to a low-carbon economy.

As an investor committed to contributing to a green and just energy transition, we expect companies tocompanies to disclose their approach to environmental and social challenges within the transition and haveamongst others, proper human rights due diligence processes in place.

We expect companies to comply with internationally recognised human rights principles and to prevent and manage their impact on hu-man rights. Human rights-related issues include human rights abuses, modern slavery, fair living wage, and child labour, occupational safetyand health, the rights of indigenous people and displacement of local communities, freedom of association and collective bargaining andinternational humanitarian law. Our expectations in these areas apply both to the investee companies themselves and to their supply chains.

The evidence of a correlation between corrupt business practices and negative effects on long-term financialreturns is growing. Corruption leads to significant business-related costs and market inefficiency and hinderseconomic, political and social development. We expect companies to take a proactive approach towardscorruption and responsible payments and ensure that adequate measures are implemented and transparencyis being elevated.

We recognise the importance of companies being accountable for and transparent about their tax practices.

We expect our portfolio companies to have a tax policy that outlines the company’s approach to taxation andhow it aligns with the overall business strategy. We also expect companies to have a robust tax governanceand management framework in place, to pay taxes where economic value is created and to provide coun-try-by-country reporting.

Each Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that overall remuneration to executive management is ap-propriate and reasonable, aligned with the strategy of the company and that it promotes a sound performancefor the company in the long term. We are in favour of variable compensation plans that are based on clearlydefined performance criteria and which include ESG criteria.

We expect a board to include a strong presence of independent non-executives members and to be diversifiedon gender, experience, age and other factors. A board should preferably have at least 40% of either gender.

Companies may contribute to and take part in policy processes to shape regulation that affects their businessobjectives as well as more broadly their activities, e.g. environmental goals.

We expect companies to carry out political engagement in a responsible manner in line with relevant guidingprinciples and frameworks. Furthermore, we expect companies to be transparent in relation to such engage-ment, including the rationale for supporting or opposing certain matters.

Biodiversity

Biodiversity loss is a systemic risk. Nature is being eroded at rates unprecedented in human history and we are facing the irreversibleloss of plant and animal species, habitats and vital crops. Biodiversity affects our food and medicine and our environment19 .

The continuing loss of biological diversity will cost the global economy several trillion euros by 205020. We expect companiesaffected by these risks to ensure that they report on how they manage the related risks and impacts adequately. NAM ́s approach toBiodiversity and Nature are further described in our White paper on biodiversity and nature.

Good governance

NAM’s ownership activities are aimed at promoting sustainable profitability and sound management of ESG risks and other risk typesin portfolio companies, in order to protect shareholder value and enhance long-term returns. Our active ownership tools include vot-ing, attending Annual General Meetings, representation on nomination committees and engagement with companies.

We believe that a sound corporate governance structure is essential for creating long-term shareholder value. The board of directorsand senior management are accountable to investors for protecting and generating value over the long term. We expect the board ofdirectors of investee companies to oversee and monitor the effectiveness of the company’s governance of environmental, social andbusiness ethics-related issues and risks and to protect shareholder rights. We engage with investee companies and use our vote onnumerous issues, including shareholder rights, board composition, remuneration and risk management.

We expect companies affected by these risks to ensure that they report on how they manage the related risks and impacts adequately.

Agricultural expansion is one of the main drivers of deforestation and the associated loss of biodiversityand soft commodity-driven deforestation presents both sustainability and financial risks for companies in anumber of industries including food products, household products, textiles and apparel. We recognise thevital role forests play in climate change mitigation, biodiversity protection and in supporting livelihoods.

Therefore, we expect all relevant companies in our portfolio that are involved in the production, trade, useor financing of forest-risk commodities, particularly palm oil, soya, timber and cattle products, to commit toeliminating deforestation and the loss of other valuable ecosystems from their operations and supply chains.Sufficient measures include, but should not be limited to, implementing a strong governance frameworkwhich clearly articulates the board’s accountability for and oversight of deforestation risks and ensurestraceability of forest-risk commodities.

Water crises have been identified as the global risk that can be the most impactful in the next 10 years.By 2025 two thirds of the world’s population will be subject to water stress. Economic growth and climatechange are putting extreme pressure on groundwater and renewable surface water resources. Waterscarcity is an issue for a number of companies that we are invested in. Certain industry sectors have in somegeographical areas of operations a particularly high exposure to water risk. We expect companies in thehigh-risk sectors to ensure that they address and manage their water risk adequately.

In line with our overall expectations on biodiversity and nature, we expect companies whose activities(including products and services) may affect sensitive areas including Natura 2000 areas, UNESCO WorldHeritage sites, Key Biodiversity Areas (‘KBAs’) as well as other protected areas specified by the EuropeanParliament and the Council, to take necessary precautions to mitigate their impact on these areas and ade-quately lay out how they manage these risks and impacts.

In line with our PAI process under SFDR, we screen for activities which negatively affect sensitive areas ona quarterly basis. Our Responsible Investments team analyses these cases before presenting the case to RICthat decides on one of three recommendations: no action, engagement or exclusion.
