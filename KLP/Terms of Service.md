1. Purpose



The purpose of the guideline is to ensure that KLP is a responsible investor and owner.

The objective is to deliver competitive returns over time, while at the same time ensuring that

KLP fulfils its commitments as a signatory to the UN Global Compacti and Principles for

Responsible Investment (PRI)ii, and contributes to a sustainable development in line with the

UN Sustainable Development Goals.



That KLP shall be a responsible investor is enshrined in KLP’s corporate strategy, corporate

responsibility strategy as well as in the investment strategy with underlying investment

principles. This guideline describes KLP’s approach to responsible investments.



Definition of a responsible investor

A responsible investor is aware of its role as an asset owner and promotes effective and well-

functioning capital markets based on stable institutions and social structures. As providers of

capital, asset owners set the tone for good management and may influence market practices.



A responsible investor seeks to integrate sustainability risk and factors in their investment

activities and active ownership. Considering sustainability risk and factors can be both

ethically and financially justified.



Sustainability risk is the potential impact on the investment’s value as a result of

environmental, social or governance-related events and/or circumstances.



Sustainability factors are environmental, social, and governmental matters, which can be

positively or negatively affected by a company’s activity.



Why it is important for KLP to be a responsible investor

Responsible investment practices are important for KLP for multiple reasons.



First and foremost, KLP shall secure and increase the value of its investments on behalf of

our customers. Given that KLP has a long-term perspective, KLP’s investments and the

underlying companies' business must be based on a responsible and sustainable value

creation. Therefore, it is in KLP’s interest to promote a long-term and sustainable value

creation in the companies KLP invests in. Concurrently, KLP’s risk and return is contingent

on efficient and well-functioning markets, and thus also that institutions and social

structures that form the basis of stable markets facilitate sustainable development.



Secondly, KLP has a responsibility for the impact our business has on society. KLP has

recognized this responsibility by becoming a signatory to the UN Global Compact and PRI.



Thirdly, KLP’s customers and owners expect KLP to act responsibly.

2. Rooted in international norms



KLP’s work on responsible investment is rooted in internationally recognized goals and

norms. These includes:



• International conventions and principles that the UN Global Compact is based on:

- UN Declaration on Human Rights,

- ILO Core Conventions,

- Rio Declaration on Environment and Development

- UN Convention against Corruption

• UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights

• Global climate and nature targets negotiated under the UN Framework Convention

on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity

• OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises

• OECD Principles of Corporate Governance and other relevant, international norms

for active ownership and corporate governance

• The Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance



3. Scope of application



This guideline forms the basis for responsible investment practices across all units in the KLP

group. The guideline is applicable to all investments and all asset classes and is to be

operationalized for each asset class in an expedient manner.



4. Roles and responsibilities



KLP’s board of directors is responsible for the overarching directions for KLP’s investments,

and therefore approves this guideline. The administration is responsible for an appropriate

organizational structure to operationalize and manage the guideline.



5. Ownership principles



The ownership principles signal to stakeholders and the market KLP’s standpoint as an

investor and owner. KLP shall execute its ownership in line with its core values open, clear,

responsible, and engaged:



1. We are open on our behaviour and way of being.

2. We are clear as an owner and we act in a predictable manner.

3. We are responsible and conscious of our corporate responsibility.

4. We are engaged in the companies we invest in and in the development of institutions

and social structures that set the framework for our investments.

6. Tools



KLP will utilise four tools in its role as a responsible investor and owner:



6.1 Integration



KLP shall integrate sustainability factors into its investment analyses and decision-making

processes. Efforts will also be made to assess the long-term effects of investment strategy and

investment decisions on sustainability factors.



6.2 Active ownership



The exercise of ownership shall be anchored in KLP’s ownership principles and exclusion

criteria, the Voting Guidelines for KLP and the KLP Funds, and international standards, as

listed above.



In line with the ownership principles, KLP shall use active ownership to influence companies,

industries, and markets to promote sustainable value creation. KLP shall develop an

ownership strategy. The exercise of ownership shall be based on the assessment of how and

in which areas it can have the greatest effect.



Appropriate means of exercising ownership include:

a) Dialogue with the company’s board of directors and management.

b) Voting and submitting shareholder proposals at general meetings.

c) Participation in corporate bodies. KLP may participate in nomination committees, but

not on the boards of listed companies. KLP may be represented on the boards of

unlisted companies in which it has a large stake or a strategic interest.

d) Promoting industry and market standards.

e) Collaboration with other investors in corporate dialogues and ownership questions.



6.3 Exclusion



KLP shall exclude from its investments any companies that are associated with gross and/or

systematic violations of generally accepted standards of business conduct. The exclusion

criteria shall be rooted in the standards mentioned above. Exclusion decisions shall be based

on thorough reviews rooted in these guidelines.



Behaviour-based exclusion criteria

KLP should exclude companies from its investments where there is an unacceptable risk that

they could contribute to or be responsible for:

a) Serious or systematic violations of human rights, such as murder, torture, deprivation

of liberty, forced labour, the worst forms of child labour, and other serious or

systematic violations of labour rights.

b) serious violations of the rights of individuals in situations of war or conflict.

c) sale of weapons to states i) in armed conflicts that use the weapons in ways that

represent serious and systematic breaches to international law governing the

conflicts, or ii) that is covered by the scheme for state bond exception described in the

mandate for the governance of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global.

d) severe environmental damage.

e) acts or omissions that on an aggregate company level led to unacceptable levels of

greenhouse gas emissions.

f) gross corruption.

g) other particularly serious violations of fundamental ethical norms.

h) other particularly serious violations of business ethics.



Product-based exclusion criteria

KLP shall not invest in companies that:



• Develop or produce weapons or key components of weapons that violate fundamental

humanitarian principles through their normal use. Such weapons include, biological

weapons, chemical weapons, nuclear weapons, non-detectable fragments, incendiary

weapons, blinding laser weapons, anti-personnel mines, and cluster munitions.

• Derive 5 percent or more revenue from coal and/or oil sands-based operations (oil

sands extraction, extraction of coal for energy purposes [thermal coal] or coal-based

power generation) have a coal power capacity of more than 10,000 MW, or mine

more than 20 million tons of thermal coal per year. In the assessment, emphasis shall

be placed on forward-looking assessments, including the construction of new capacity

and plans that will reduce the coal-based share or increase the share of renewable

energy sources.

• Produce tobacco, alcohol, non-medical cannabis, gambling services or pornography.



Due diligence-based exclusions

KLP shall perform due diligence assessments in the investments and may decide on due

diligence-based exclusions of companies if there is an unacceptable risk of company

contributing to the violation of KLP’s guideline based on a combination of country, sector,

and company risk.



Exclusion by the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global

KLP shall observe exclusions from the Government Pension Fund Global made according to

the current Guidelines for Observation and Exclusion from the Government Pension Fund

Global, and generally follow these exclusions.



Government bonds

KLP shall not invest in the lowest-ranked countries in the World Bank’s Worldwide

Governance Indicators (WGI).



Excluding a government bond from the investment universe does not normally require the

exclusion of other forms of investment in the same country.



Sanctions

KLP shall comply with sanctions and freezing provisions implemented in Norwegian law, and

shall monitor investments against relevant sanction lists, including sanction lists from the

UN and the EU.



6.4 Impact investments



KLP shall have a portfolio of investments that, in addition to financial returns, is dedicated to

contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The portfolio may have a somewhat

higher risk than what is normally used as a basis for KLP’s investments.

shall:

- Assess the work of external managers on integrating sustainability risk and factors.

- Follow up on external managers’ adherence to this guideline.



Wherever possible, external managers should comply with KLP’s exclusion criteria and

normally follow KLP’s exclusion list.

KLP shall report externally on how the guideline is complied with, compared to current legal

requirements and best practices for sustainability reporting in the financial industry. The

reporting shall include any updates to the list of excluded companies and supporting

rationales. KLP shall be open about its ownership activities, which includes publishing its

voting decisions.
