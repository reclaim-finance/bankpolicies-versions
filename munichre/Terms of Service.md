Responsible Investment Guideline

Policy of Munich Re GroupVersion: 1 December 2024

2



1 Objective



This Responsible Investment Guideline (RIG) outlines the general framework for Group investment activities,prescribing responsible standards and requirements that are to be upheld within Munich Re Group in order toimplement sustainability in our investment strategy, considering environmental, social and governance criteria.

As Munich Re is aware of its responsibility and influence as a large asset owner and investor, the integration ofsustainability criteria is a key element of our investment strategy. We use both general sustainability criteria whichare explained in our Sustainability reporting (e.g. climate, biodiversity and human rights) and specificsustainability criteria tailored to asset classes (e.g. energy efficiency or ESG ratings).

Munich Re was one of the first signatories of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). In 2020, MunichRe joined the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) and committed to clear GHG-reduction targets. In additionto these targets, ESG-focused investments aim to generate a positive sustainable effect alongside financialreturns. In line with its climate strategy, Munich Re specifically aims to significantly increase its investmentexposure in renewable energies over time.



2 Scope of application



2.1 Entities in scope

This Guideline is directly applicable to Munich Reinsurance Company including its branches and representativeoffices. All Munich Re (Group) entities 1 with licenses for primary insurance or reinsurance and our internal assetmanagers (MEAG AMG, Munich Re Investment Partners) will implement the objectives, principles andrequirements as stipulated herein by adopting this Guideline or introducing an equivalent norm, or by otheradequate means. As concerns third party asset managers, we strive to contractually agree the application of thisGuideline or a comparable standard.

Should any provision of this Guideline be contrary to local law, the latter shall always take precedence.

2.2 Assets in scope

The RIG applies to the investment of proprietary assets of Munich Re, irrespective of whether they are managedby Munich Re itself, by Group Investment Management (GIM), by our internal asset managers (MEAG, MunichRe Investment Partners) or by a third party.

This Guideline focuses on direct investments in the asset classes of equities, corporates, government andcovered bonds, and in alternative investments, with minor exceptions as detailed below. We aim to extend thescope of the RIG to encompass all assets wherever possible, depending on various factors such as asset-classcharacteristics, industry standards, and the constantly evolving data and analytics environment, and we willreview this on at least a yearly basis.

The RIG does not apply to assets held or derivatives used to manage, cover or hedge reinsurance financialstructures (e.g. hedging platforms), products sold as risk management solutions or finance products for non-Group clients. For the avoidance of doubt, any assets/derivatives in the International Financial Reporting

1 Entities include affiliated Group companies (subsidiaries) and branches. Affiliated companies of Munich Reinsurance Company include all MunichRe (Group) companies in which Munich Reinsurance Company (in)directly holds the majority of capital and/or voting rights or which are (in)directlycontrolled by Munich Reinsurance Company (by way of agreement or de facto).

3

Standards (IFRS) category "Insurance-related Investment" are out of scope of the RIG and are instead subjectto the guidelines applicable to the Munich Re insurance business.

For indirect investment products (fund investments), compliance with RIG requirements, e.g. exclusions, cannotbe ensured by Munich Re, GIM, MEAG or other asset managers assigned with managing Munich Re assets. Weaim to identify these investment products and to apply sustainability processes to them as far as feasible, e.g. bysuggesting model clauses for the integration of biodiversity considerations. In accordance with the InvestmentGuideline for Infrastructure Funds, if a specific exclusion is not possible, this has to be made transparent in theGIM Alternative Investments Investment Committee (GIM AIIC). For private equity and private debt funds, theasset manager should make best efforts to negotiate the inclusion of the relevant restrictions in the fund anddocument the efforts or encourage the fund manager to include our exclusions and restrictions into theproduction/portfolio selection process.

For mutual funds/ exchange traded funds, it is not possible to negotiate the inclusion of specific restrictions withthe manager, and transparency on the funds’ contents is limited. Therefore, due care must be taken in theselection process before buying ETFs and mutual funds. We analyse sustainability criteria such as MSCI ratingsand other available data to ensure a best effort approach in the selection process.



3 Governance



Strategic decisions on sustainability in investments are made by the Board of Management in the ESG Committee(ESG C), supported by the ESG Management Team (ESG MT). On the investment side, the ESG InvestmentCommittee (ESG IC) focuses specifically on the implementation of the sustainability strategy in investments. Inaddition, the GIM AIIC is focusing particularly on manners related to alternative assets.As a member of the Board of Management, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) is responsible for the Group'sinvestment management. The GIM division, which reports to the CIO, is the asset owner function responsible forthe Group's sustainable investment strategy and has set up its own Sustainability in Investments team for thispurpose. Within our investment community, there are dedicated sustainability teams within GIM and our internalasset managers MEAG and Munich Re Investment Partners.In order to anchor the topic of sustainability in our investment processes, the Sustainability in Investments teamis supported by ESG multipliers throughout GIM. This structure is also mirrored in asset management at MEAG,which manages a large proportion of our investments. The targeted implementation of the sustainability strategyby MEAG is supported by membership of GIM's ESG IC, by the constant exchange of information between thesustainability teams in the investment area and by the ESG multipliers in the various portfolio management teams.

The GIM Reputational Risk Committee (GIM RRC) supports our efforts to address sustainability risks holisticallyby analysing and assessing reputational risks in the investment area. Munich Re understands reputational riskas a risk of possible damage to Munich Re Group's reputation, which arises as a consequence of a negativepublic perception, deteriorated rating or company value, etc. Sensitive issues that could lead to reputational riskshave to be dealt with by adhering to the risk management and compliance processes. The GIM RRC gets involvedif a reputational risk is indicated regarding individual investments as far as Munich Re has the power to directindividual transactions, or investment-related documents that are negotiated with asset managers. Respectivereputational risk committees have been established for each business segment. These committees, ifapproached with a reputation risk case in their area of responsibility, review and decide whether such plannedtransactions are appropriate.

The existing processes of the risk management policy/compliance policy and its rules of procedure must becomplied with. This also applies in the event of potential reputational issues.

4 Approach to sustainability



The systematic integration of sustainability criteria into our investment management activities is a fundamentalcomponent of our investment strategy. Our investment strategy comprises four key elements: systematicintegration of sustainability criteria in the investment processes, defined exclusion and restriction criteria, selectedESG-focused investments such as renewable energy and green bonds, as well as stewardship activities includingengagement and proxy voting. In addition, we require that all our asset managers apply sustainability criteriawhen managing our portfolios.

It is our conviction that integrating sustainability criteria into investment decisions contributes to a better, moreholistic risk management of the assets we own. Our belief is that sustainability integration leads to higher risk-adjusted returns in the long-term. We combine various approaches to the integration of sustainability criteriaacross our investment value chain, from the strategic asset allocation to asset management, such as ESG-focused investing (which e.g. aims to contribute to climate change mitigation, see section 4.4), norm-basedexclusion criteria (e.g. coal or human rights), holistic stewardship practices, and the inclusion of sustainabilitycriteria in financial analysis. This helps us to identify risks and opportunities beyond standard financial analysis.

Our sustainability teams within GIM and at our internal asset managers work closely with sustainability expertswhen integrating sustainability aspects into our investment processes. External data providers supply us withissuer-specific ESG ratings, KPIs (e.g. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission data), and issuer-specific screening ofbusiness activities and controversies, according to our needs. We use relevant research data in our financialanalysis, to better understand sustainability risks and opportunities, and as input when screening investmentsregarding specific sustainability topics as well as exclusion criteria. They also serve as input for screening themajority of our assets for specific sustainability criteria.

4.1 Integration of sustainability criteria

Sustainability criteria can only be integrated into the investment process if they are made transparent throughcorresponding data and analysis. We aim to constantly increase the integration of sustainability criteria byscreening listed assets for issuer ESG ratings and analysing specific sustainability criteria for alternative assets.

As sustainability plays an important role for Munich Re Group, sustainability criteria are part of the M\&A processwhen considering investments in new strategic participations, within the strategic fit assessment and, whendeemed relevant, in the due diligence.

The following themes are especially important to us when integrating sustainability aspects into our investmentdecisions:



Biodiversity

The urgency to address biodiversity loss and its implications for asset owners cannot be overstated. Theescalating concern over the extent of biodiversity loss has led to a heightened focus on this issue in sustainabilitydiscussions at the corporate level. As companies face increasing scrutiny and pressure to disclose theirenvironmental risks, asset owners also recognise the relevance of biodiversity in their investment decisions.



Controversial weapons

Weapon-related business is a sensitive international topic. Munich Re Group adopts a prudent approach andcarefully assesses potential impacts that such business might have on our reputation. The Group has committeditself not to support businesses that do not fully comply with international conventions. Hence, we exclude

5

investments in issuers involved in weapon categories that are considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiablesuffering to combatants or to affect civilians indiscriminately and that are deemed inhumane by internationalconventions.



Food-related transactions

Munich Re sees investments in food-related commodities critically from a sustainability perspective, as they maycause social imbalances.



Human rights

With its Declaration of Principles on the Respect and Protection of Human Rights, Munich Re has expressed theimportance of human rights and the high priority they have for the entire Group. This means that we underpin ourunderstanding of responsibility for human rights by recognising international guidelines and standards.



Oil \& Gas

The Oil and Gas sector faces an increasing need to understand the implications of the energy transition for itsoperations and business models, and to explain the contributions it can make to reducing GHG emissions andachieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Our dedicated emission reduction targets are elaborated in the nextchapter.



Oil sands

The detrimental effects of extracting oil from oil sands (also known as tar sands) can be significant for theenvironment and local communities. Among other things, extracting oil from oil sands consumes more energyand resources than the extraction and refining of conventional oil, and it is among the most carbon-intensivemethods of crude oil production. Our dedicated emission reduction targets are elaborated in the next chapter.



Thermal Coal

Since power generated by thermal coal is responsible for two-thirds of the emissions that come from the energysector globally, we see reducing thermal coal as a major accelerator for reaching net zero. The firing of thermalcoal for energy is the single largest contributor to man-made global temperature increase (see "Position Paper:Thermal Coal" by the NZAOA 2). Our dedicated emission reduction targets are elaborated in the next chapter.

4.2 GHG reduction targets

In December 2020, as part of our Munich Re Group Ambition 2025, Munich Re set clear decarbonisation targetsfor the direct asset classes listed equities, corporate bonds and real estate, based on the target setting frameworkof the NZAOA. As an intermediate step, we aim to reduce net GHG emissions for these asset classes in theGroup’s investment portfolio by 25% to 29% by 2025 (compared to the 2019 base year), in order to achieve netzero emissions by 2050. We have also set specific reduction targets for 2025 for direct listed equities andcorporate bonds in the Oil \& Gas (- 25%) and thermal coal (- 35%) sectors, and to fully exit investments in thermalcoal by 2040. We assess this at Group level, i.e. individual legal entities can exceed or fall short of the target aslong as the overall target is reached across the Group as a whole. All GHG emissions are measured in CO2-equivalent (CO2e).

4.3 Exclusions and restrictions

We define exclusions from and restrictions on the investment universe to avoid undesirable activities that do notfit our sustainability strategy. We implement our exclusions on issuers for which we detect a unique identifier thatis suitable for implementation at our asset managers. For indirect investment products, compliance with RIGrequirements, e.g. exclusions, cannot be ensured. We aim to identify these investment products and to applysustainability processes to them as far as feasible, e.g. by suggesting model clauses for the integration ofbiodiversity considerations.



4.3.1 Regarding liquid assets



Exclusions are implemented using the centrally managed "listed issuer exclusion lists" 3 based on our negativescreening process and criteria, which are binding for all of our asset managers. GIM Sustainability in Investmentsreviews the lists of excluded issuers on a quarterly basis to the best of their knowledge regarding the screenedissuers. Exclusions and restrictions are applicable to either listed equities, corporate bonds, commodities, andsovereigns, sub-sovereigns and government agencies or several of those asset classes as described below.

4.3.1.1 Listed equity and corporate bonds



4.3.1.1.1 Controversial weapons



Munich Re rules out direct investments in equities or bonds of issuers 4 verifiably involved in controversialweapons and key components through their own operations, through a subsidiary (majority ownership /controlling shareholder), through a joint venture (regardless of ownership stake) or as a bond issuer issuing debtfor a company that is verifiably involved in controversial weapons. This refers to companies which are verifiablyinvolved in the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, or transfer of controversial weapons,as well as assistance in any of these activities. We define controversial weapons according to the followingweapon categories:

• Anti-personnel mines

• Cluster munitions

• Biological weapons

• Chemical weapons

• Blinding laser weapons

• Incendiary weapons (excluding white phosphorus weapons)

• Non-detectable fragments



3 We implement our exclusions on issuers for which we detect a unique identifier that is suitable for implementation at our asset managers.

4 We implement our exclusions on issuers for which we detect a unique identifier that is suitable for implementation at our asset managers.

4.3.1.1.2 Human rights



In order to integrate human rights considerations into our investment decisions, we conduct a Group-wide riskanalysis: A norm-based screening based on external data is assessed and internally validated.This due diligence process, steered by the Group Sustainability Department (Munich Re Group Human RightsOfficer), involves a scoring methodology consisting of the principles of the UN Global Compact and a customizedHuman Rights Violator Index. The index consists of various human rights-related factors such as humantrafficking and forced labour. As a preventive measure, direct investments in equities and bonds issued byidentified companies showing confirmed significant human rights violations are not permitted. The methodologyfor identifying such companies is being continuously evolved. GIM monitors the portfolio regularly and evaluatesremediation measures in the case of an ad-hoc event.

4.3.1.1.3 Oil \& Gas



We screen companies in the Oil \& Gas sector and analyse the intensity and development of their GHG emissions.For the sector target, we use the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sub-Industries. For the purposeof calculating our GHG footprint, we define relevant Oil and Gas sectors as Oil \& Gas Exploration \& Production,Oil \& Gas Refining \& Marketing, Oil \& Gas Drilling and Integrated Oil \& Gas.In order to further facilitate the achievement of the Paris Climate Agreement’s targets, we cease to make newdirect investments in pure-play Oil \& Gas companies as of 1 April 2023. We define pure-play Oil \& Gas companiesas listed companies within the GICS Oil \& Gas Subindustries except Integrated Oil \& Gas.



As of 1 January 2025, for new investments, we will require a credible commitment from listed Integrated Oil \&Gas companies to net zero GHG emissions by 2050 including corresponding short- and mid-term milestones.These companies are selected and assessed based on data provided by Institutional Shareholder Service (ISS)ESG, a recognized provider of sustainability-related data analysis. If, in an exceptional case, this data is regardedas outdated or incomplete, Integrated Oil \& Gas companies may be subject to a comprehensive assessment byinternal research analysts using additional data sources, which may result in the exclusion or inclusion of therespective company. Additional data sources may include but are not limited to Climate Action 100+ Net-ZeroCompany Benchmark, Carbon Disclosure Project and Transition Pathway Initiative.

Exceptions apply for green bonds and engagement under specific conditions:We may selectively invest in green bonds issued by Oil \& Gas companies which are compliant with an accreditedgreen bond framework (such as the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles orthe EU Green Bond Standard), which have been assessed by an external review provider and where the issuerhas a public commitment to a 2050 net zero target (or Paris-aligned pathway). Under specific conditions, GIMSustainability in Investments may decide to engage with companies in line with the approach outlined in section4.5 rather than ceasing to invest.



Exclusion

4.3.1.1.4 Oil sands



Munich Re does not directly invest in equities or bonds of companies that derive more than 10% of their revenuesfrom oil sands extraction. We may selectively invest in green bonds issued by oil sands companies which arecompliant with an accredited green bond framework (such as the International Capital Market Association (ICMA)Green Bond Principles or the EU Green Bond Standard), which have been assessed by an external reviewprovider and where the issuer has a public commitment to a 2050 net zero target (or Paris-aligned pathway).

4.3.1.1.5 Thermal coal



For thermal coal, we apply two types of exclusions:One, relative exclusion criteria where we rule out direct investments in listed equities or corporate bonds ofcompanies that:

• derive more than 15% of their revenues from thermal coal mining and/or the generation of electricity fromthermal coal firing.Two, absolute exclusion criteria where we rule out direct investments in listed equities or corporate bonds ofcompanies that:

• have an annual thermal coal production above 10 Mt, or

• have an installed coal-fired generation capacity above 5 GW.

• Companies, affected by absolute exclusion criteria regarding coal production and installed capacity, that havea credible commitment to net zero GHG emissions by 2050, including corresponding short- and mid-termmilestones, are exempted. These companies are selected and assessed based on data provided by ISSESG. If, in an exceptional case, this data is regarded as outdated or incomplete, absolute thermal coalexclusions may be subject to a comprehensive assessment by internal research analysts using additionaldata sources, which may result in the exclusion or inclusion of the respective company. Additional datasources may include but are not limited to Climate Action 100+ Net-Zero Company Benchmark, CarbonDisclosure Project and Transition Pathway Initiative.For both types of exclusions, an exception for green bonds and engagement applies und specific conditions:In order to support the transition to a low carbon economy and to finance the transition of the issuer, green bondsissued by affected companies remain investable under specific conditions: The issuer must publicly commit to a2050 net zero target (or Paris-aligned pathway) and to a thermal coal exit by 2040 at the latest. Moreover, thegreen bond must be compliant with an accredited Green Bond Framework (such as ICMA Green Bond Principlesor EU Green Bond Standard) and assessed by an external review provider.



Exclusion

4.3.1.2.1 ESG country rating



Direct investments in sovereigns, sub-sovereigns, and government agencies of countries rated "CCC" by MSCI(ESG rating scale AAA-CCC) are not permitted.



4.3.1.2.2 Human Rights



For sovereign, sub-sovereign and government agency risk analysis, we apply a specific human rights countryscore based on an external data provider taking into account factors such as modern slavery, forced labour, andchild labour.We monitor our portfolio accordingly and exclude countries with extreme risks. GIM regularly monitors theexposure to countries with high risk. The methodology regarding the human rights country rating is beingcontinuously evolved.

4.3.2 Regarding alternative assets



We integrate sustainability criteria in the investment processes of alternative asset classes as described belowand we continuously aspire to provide "best effort" sustainability processes as far as feasible. In the field ofalternative assets, we have defined ESG-focused investments that aim to contribute to e.g. climate changemitigation (see section 4.4).

When making direct alternative investments, we assess new investments within the due diligence process usingsustainability criteria. The sustainability assessment is also part of the risk management second opinion compiledby our internal asset manager MEAG. For indirect investment products, compliance with RIG requirements, e.g.exclusions, cannot be ensured. We aim to identify these investment products and to apply sustainabilityprocesses to them as far as feasible.

For the following alternative assets, we apply certain exclusions or require certain standards (restrictions) aslisted per sub-asset class below.

4.3.2.1 Infrastructure investments



4.3.2.1.1 Biodiversity



We are conducting a review of alternative investments, except private equity and private debt funds, using theIntegrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) as part of the due diligence process. IBAT provides commercialusers with spatial data on biodiversity globally from several key datasets, such as natural and mixed UN WorldHeritage Sites (as defined by the UNESCO World Heritage Convention).We do not conduct direct alternative majority investments via our internal asset managers in critical industries 5,if a material portion of the underlying assets are situated in a natural or mixed World Heritage Site. In ambiguouscases (e.g. regarding materiality or a project in non-critical industries), the GIM AIIC is informed and may involvethe GIM RRC.

4.3.2.2 Forestry \& agriculture investments



4.3.2.2.1 Certifications



Sustainability considerations are comprehensively integrated into the investment process. Environmental, climatechange, and biodiversity aspects, as well as human rights and workforce safety issues, are among the majortopics considered.

For forestry investments, we focus on the asset managers / property managers and analyse their respectivecertifications, placing specific demands on them: Munich Re stipulates that asset managers / property managersmust ensure that the management of all certifiable forestry investments is certified by Forest Stewardship Council(FSC), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), or equivalently within 5 years ofacquisition. Forestry investments that will not meet this requirement are not allowed.

4.3.2.2.2 Sustainability specifics in the due diligence process



For each new direct forestry \& agriculture investment made by the internal asset manager, detailed “ESG CriteriaEvaluation for Forestry Investments” and “ESG Criteria Evaluation for Agricultural Investments” questionnairesare applied, shedding light on sustainability aspects, including biodiversity and human rights. Moreover, theMunich Re internal assessment framework is applied that covers physical climate risks. When taking theinvestment decision, the internal asset manager presents key findings from the ESG checklist to the GIM AIIC.For investments made by the internal asset manager MEAG, the MEAG ESG and Sustainable Finance team isinvolved in the due diligence process.

4.3.2.3.2 General Partner’s PRI signature by or sustainability policy



For our new investments in private equity, private debt and infrastructure funds, we check whether the generalpartner (GP) has signed the PRI or whether the GP has its own sustainability policy. We take this into accountwhen deciding on the selection of the GP. Depending on the product/investment, this is done by either GIM orMEAG. We also inform the GP about additional restrictions as per this Guideline and our wish to include thesein a side letter.

External Real Estate Investments

Specific requirements for third party asset managers



For third party asset managers, we focus on managers who have fully integrated sustainability considerationsacross the investment lifecycle. Real estate specific sustainability roles and responsibilities are a must.Investment strategies have to comply with a set of minimum sustainability criteria (e.g. Green Buildingcertification). An ESG rating like Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) is an advantage.



Real Estate Debt (Mortgages)

Sustainability specifics in the lending policy



The sustainability approach in Real Estate Debt is currently expanded from sustainability exclusion criteria tosustainability selection criteria.However, being a debt lender implies no direct access to the underlying real estate assets which is why aprofound sustainability assessment depends on the data quality provided by the investor / owner of the building.Please see the listed measures and implementations in the key topic areas.

4.3.3 Third party asset managers



4.3.3.1 Selection process

Munich Re only works with asset managers with dedicated sustainability capabilities, and only selects assetmanagers who are UN PRI signatories or in the process of becoming one. Exceptions are decided on by GIMRRC.



Figure 14: Decision tree for third party asset manager selection



A Request for Proposal must be filled out by potential asset managers, outlining their sustainability capabilities,strategy and research approach. It also covers the individual approach regarding engagements, as well as GHGfootprint measurement, decarbonisation, biodiversity, and human rights within the investment process. GHGemission reporting capabilities are required for markets / asset classes where relevant data is available, withsufficient quality. The evaluation of the questionnaire is followed by a detailed dialogue with the asset managersto further evaluate their sustainability efforts. The selection process continues with scoring of the asset managers,including a dedicated section for sustainability considerations. According to this, the best fitting asset manager isselected and the onboarding process starts.

4.3.3.2 Target setting and monitoring

For mandates in a liquid asset class, we aim to assign a decarbonisation target for 2025. If the target is not met,intensified discussions will be initiated with the asset manager.The asset managers are monitored on a regular basis where ESG integration, sustainability policies, andengagement topics are reviewed. This is done via annual reporting and review meetings by the Asset ManagerSelection Team and the GIM Sustainability in Investments Team.

4.3.3.3 Compliance and escalation

In liquid mandates, non-Group managers need to comply with the Munich Re exclusion list in the asset classesfixed income and equities. The exclusions are then coded into the asset manager’s limit system where potentialviolations will be blocked. If an excluded name is traded, it will result in an active breach of the InvestmentGuideline. Respective escalation mechanisms are described in the chapter on implementation, monitoring andescalation of this Guideline.

For illiquid mandates, in the contractual negotiations with external asset managers, we aim to include a referenceto the Munich Re exclusion list. It is the explicit obligation of the Asset Manager to ensure strict adherence tocontractual agreements. In the event of non-compliance, the Asset Manager shall take immediate correctiveaction to remedy the situation and notify GIM. Failure to do so will result in the mandate being categorically

23

downgraded to "red" status, as reflected in GIM's quarterly internal reviews, and a formal alert will be issued toAIIC via a red light note. The next steps will be agreed and implemented jointly.

4.4 ESG-focused investments

We call thematic investments that aim to positively contribute to our sustainable investment strategy, ESG-focused investments. Currently, these are renewable energy investments, certified real estate investments,forests with certified management and green bonds. In the medium-term, we aim to extend the range of theseESG-focused investments amongst others to accord with regulatory developments, specifically with regard to theclassification of investments according to the EU taxonomy.



4.4.1 Renewable energy investments



We seek to invest in renewable energy investments to promote the energy transition. We define renewableenergy investments as investments into energy production facilities and related infrastructure (e.g. includingpower, heat, fuel production, storage and grids) based on renewable energy sources (e.g. including solar, wind,geothermal and hydro energy). In line with our ambition until 2025, we have increased our investments inrenewable energy to over €3 billion.



4.4.2 Certified real estate investments



We define certified real estate investments as those which are certified by "EU Green Building", "BuildingResearch Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)", "Leadership in Energy andEnvironmental Design (LEED)", "Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen (DGNB)" or that have otherequivalent certifications.

New direct real estate investments must obtain an ecolabel or a recognised level of certification. If an investmentproperty is not certified, the asset manager must determine the measures required for certification and factor thecosts of these measures into the cash flow base case to initiate a certification process..

It is also necessary to ensure sustainability compatibility of optimisations/revitalisations of existing properties.Measures to achieve the mentioned certifications are highly recommended in order to improve the sustainabilityof the existing portfolio.



4.4.3 Certified forest management



We define sustainable forest investments, if the management has an existing certification by FSC, PEFC or anequivalent certification. The asset manager assesses each investment individually using sustainability criteriaduring the due diligence.

Sustainability criteria should be promoted and integrated into the ongoing management activities. Independentreviews of applied management practices from FSC, PEFC or equivalent certifiers are of utmost importance, asthey verify ongoing sustainable forest management activities.



4.4.4 Green bonds



We understand green bonds as bonds that are linked to investments like renewable energies, sustainable wastemanagement, biodiversity conservation or sustainable land use according to our data provider. This classificationis based on the issuing documents, stock exchange announcements or information from parties involved in the

24

issue (e.g. lead managers). Moreover, green bonds we report on, have to be compliant with an accredited greenbond framework (such as the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles or the EUGreen Bond Standard) and assessed by an external review provider.

We will continuously refine this approach taking into account the changing regulatory environment. As outlinedunder the restrictions regarding thermal coal, oil sands and Oil \& Gas above, we may invest in green bonds ofcompanies on our exclusion lists under specific exemptions.

4.5 Stewardship approach

Munich Re engages (mainly via asset managers and in some specific cases also directly) with investees/issuersto promote high sustainability standards. Stewardship aspects, we focus on, include:

• engaging with investees/issuers, and with our asset managers (please also refer to section 4.3.3),

• holding them to account on defined material issues,

• collaborating with others (e.g., NZAOA, Climate Action 100+, PRI advance) 9, and

• exercising voting rights and responsibilities.One focus area of our stewardship activities is pursuing our goals towards achieving net zero which is part of oursustainable investment strategy. It has the potential to contribute to the Paris Agreement targets. Furthermore,we also engage our external asset managers on their sustainability policies.



4.5.1 Governance and escalation mechanisms



For the assets in scope of this policy, GIM sets the framework for engagement and voting activities. As ourinternal asset manager, MEAG fulfils most of the stewardship activities in close contact and guidance with GIM.Third party asset managers are expected to carry out their own stewardship approach and regularly have toreport on their activities.

The ESG IC approves proposed stewardship targets (e.g. company engagements or proxy voting activities) witha focus on meeting climate investment goals, sustainability risks, controversies and opportunities, as well asgeneral stewardship matters that protect the investment interests of Munich Re. These goals are reviewed on aregular basis. As an escalation mechanism, the ESG IC decides on investment consequences for specificholdings where stewardship goals are not met. Regarding proxy voting, the ESG IC is informed on an annualbasis and discusses the proxy voting results of the season.



4.5.2 Scope



Our stewardship activities focus on engagement with our current and potential investees, or with other issuersaccording to a dedicated selection process. Currently, we are focusing on top polluting companies of our listedequity and corporate bonds portfolio. Furthermore, we are part of a sovereign engagement pilot. Engagementsare performed mainly through a collaborative engagement approach mainly via MEAG’s Center of Competencefor Stewardship.

For equities, MEAG is instructed in accordance with a specific process to exercise and disclose proxy-votingrights at the annual general meeting on behalf of Munich Re. Proxy voting is also considered as a measure tohold investee companies accountable.

9 Antitrust regulations must be complied with.

4.5.3 Approach



In the engagement dialogue, material topics, such as high standards of corporate governance, and responsiblemanagement of environmental and social aspects, are addressed. Our focus topics include climateconsiderations relating to the targets set within the climate strategy, as well as our expansion to human rights byendorsing the collaborative platform PRI advance.

GIM analyses invested companies according to selective criteria, such as GHG footprint, investment value, aswell as sector, and compares them to the engagement possibilities within CA100+. Engagements are chosen inrelation to material financed GHG emissions, climate strategy and issuer goals. Our climate strategy placesspecial focus on the sectors thermal coal and Oil \& Gas. For both sectors, a process is in place to engageinvestees for an emission reduction. To qualify for an engagement, specific requirements are considered: Theissuer must publicly commit to a 2050 net zero target (or Paris-aligned pathway). For coal companies the issuermust additionally commit to a thermal coal exit by 2040 at the latest.Regarding our proxy voting recommendation, we pay a special focus to contributing to the Group Ambition andhence to net zero topics.



4.5.4 Engagement



Our Group-internal asset manager MEAG engages target companies mainly through collaborative engagements.One platform of collaborative engagement is Climate Action 100+, joined by Munich Re and MEAG in 2020, aswe are convinced that positive change is achieved through a constructive dialogue with our investees/issuers.Our engagements - conducted by MEAG’s Center of Competence for Stewardship - are focused on a lastingimprovement of the management of climate risks and opportunities of investees/issuer. MEAG’s engagementapproach is outlined in the MEAG Engagement Policy 10.



4.5.5 Voting activities



MEAG is required to exercise voting rights for our investments at the annual general meeting on behalf of MunichRe. It is important to us to reflect the engagement success when exercising our voting rights. In case of conflictof interest in relation to proxy voting, we have processes in place. Details regarding our framework related tovoting activities, and the voting results, are made transparent in the MEAG Proxy Voting Policy 11 and the MEAGParticipation Policy 12.

4.5.6 Monitoring, reporting and disclosure



GIM oversees all engagement and voting activities and monitors their progress by setting a framework forreporting. For MEAG-conducted engagements, this is achieved via a dedicated template to track progress whichis discussed and reviewed on a quarterly basis by GIM and MEAG. Furthermore, all asset managers are requiredto report their engagement activities to GIM on an annual basis (also ad hoc where necessary). Overall, theengagement seasons are reviewed and discussed in the ESG IC. A special focus is placed on companies thathave been engaged for 3 years already: a detailed discussion is taking place if the engagement is achieving theexpected progress in order to decide on its continuation and potential escalation. The proxy voting season ismade transparent by MEAG through their public voting report 13.
