INTRODUCTION



The Intesa Sanpaolo Group (hereinafter the "Group"), in line with the principles of the "Code of

Ethics" and with its adherence to important international initiatives, such as the United Nations Global

Compact and the Equator Principles, is one of the European financial groups signatories of all major

sustainability initiatives of the United Nations concerning the financial sector, with the aim of

achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, in 2021 the Group joined the Net-

Zero alliances on credit, investments and insurance.

Intesa Sanpaolo’s goal is long-term sustainable value-creation for all its stakeholders. Achieving the

Net-Zero target by 2050, supporting enterprises’ transition plans, increasingly offering sustainable

investment products, promoting social inclusion and reducing social inequalities are some of the

commitments contained in the ESG pillar of the 2022-2025 Business Plan (the Plan).

In particular, the Plan outlines the Net-Zero-aligned 2030 goals concerning financed emissions

relating to credit activity in the Oil \& Gas, Power Generation, Automotive and Coal mining sectors,

which together represent over 60% of financed emissions of the non-financial corporations portfolio

in the sectors indicated by the Net Zero Banking Alliance. Furthermore, the Plan outlines Intesa

Sanpaolo’s commitment to obtain validation of the emission reduction goals in accordance with the

"Science Based Target initiative" (SBTi).

The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI) outlines the climate-neutrality goals for the asset

management sector. In particular, the members’ commitments include the following:

• Asset Level Alignment Target, by which asset managers commit to identify the share of

assets, defined as Portfolio in Scope, which will be managed with the aim of achieving climate

neutrality by 2050;

• Portfolio Level Reference Target, which represents the intermediate targets for 2030 for the

Portfolio in Scope: the asset management companies, Eurizon, Fideuram ISPB Asset

Management SGR and Fideuram Asset Management Ireland dac, expressed the ambition to

halve financed emissions by 2030;

• Stewardship and Engagement Target, which includes a commitment to establish solid

interaction plans with member companies in order to incentivize them to implement effective

decarbonization paths: the aim is to reach 90% of financed emissions;

• Investment in Climate Solutions, by which the signatories commit to increasing investments

in eco-sustainable activities.

As part of the aforementioned initiative, specific recommendations are also provided for investing in

companies that are planning or are engaged in new thermal coal projects and associated

infrastructure (energy, mining) or in oil sands exploitation projects.

With the aim of fair and responsible provision of financial services, the Group, in implementation of

the "Group Guidelines for the governance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks" and

in line with the indications contained therein, has decided, through this document, to regulate its

operations in the Oil \& Gas sector.

With these Rules, the Group also intends to support the energy transition through granting

sustainable credit to clients operating in the Oil \& Gas sector.



1 CONTEXT



The 2015 Paris Agreement goals pose important challenges for the entire economic system and in

particular the energy sector, which is one of the main sources of GHG emissions.

The share of coal, oil and natural gas in global energy supplies – which stood at around 80% in the

past decades – is starting to decline and is projected to reach 73% in the STEPS (Stated Policy

Scenario) by 20301, which is an important development. However, if the demand for fossil fuels



1 Summary of the International Energy's World Energy Outlook

Page 4 of 9



remains elevated, as in the case of coal in recent years and as projected by STEPS with respect to

oil and gas, the efforts will not be sufficient to meet global climate goals.

The Announced Pledges Scenario2 projects that the total energy demand will flatten, thanks to

efficiency improvements and the more widespread use of electricity-powered technologies, such as

electric vehicles and heat pumps, compared to fossil fuel-based ones. In the Net Zero Emissions by

2050 scenario, electrification and efficiency gains would lead to a decline in primary energy

consumption of 1.2% per year until 20303.

In 2023, the European legislation, taking into account scientific advice and the current state of

technology, considered that investments in the gas and nuclear sectors can play a significant role in

supporting the transition towards climate neutrality by including these resources in the European

taxonomy albeit under rigorous conditions: in particular, nuclear activities must meet nuclear and

environmental safety requirements and gas plants must contribute to the transition from coal to

renewables4.

From an ESG risk perspective, however, the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves can

have negative impacts on the environment and communities, especially with reference to activities

related to the oil and the unconventional oil \& gas sectors.

The Oil \& Gas industry is also launching exploration and production in new geographical areas, often

characterized by fragile ecosystems. These ecosystems represent an important heritage in terms of

biodiversity, have an important role in regulating the planet's climate and can be irremediably

damaged in crisis situations such as, for example, in the event of an oil spill.



2 SCOPE OF APPLICATION OF THE RULES



These Rules apply globally to the entire Intesa Sanpaolo Group with reference to the financing and

investment activities described in chapter 3.

Furthermore, the Rules refer to the Oil \& Gas sector as a whole and therefore to all its operating

segments:

• Up-stream

• Mid-stream

• Down-stream

• Trading

Specific limits and exclusions are foreseen for some activities with greater criticality from an

environmental point of view, in particular with reference to "unconventional5" resources which most

frequently cause contamination of the soil and aquifers and biodiversity damages due to, among

other things, use of manufactured chemicals.



3 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION CRITERIA



3.1 Exclusions and limitations to operations in the Oil \& Gas sector



With the aim of addressing exposures in line with the commitments undertaken, limits, early warnings

and Key Risk Indicators have been introduced for the counterparties within the scope.

In particular, for the Oil and Gas sector, the following is envisaged:

• a sector limit aimed at containing exposure to the sector, reviewed annually;



2 The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), established in 2021, illustrates the extent to which announced ambitions and targets can

deliver the emissions reductions that are needed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. It includes all recent major national

announcements starting from the end of August 2023, both 2030 targets and long-term commitments on net zero or carbon neutrality,

regardless of whether these announcements were anchored in legislation or in the updated nationally determined contributions.

• a limit defined on the basis of the CO2 emissions of the counterparties belonging to the

sector; this limit is reviewed annually in line with the Net-Zero Banking Alliance commitments.

These limitations are aimed at directing financial resources towards the best in class counterparties

in terms of transition to a sustainable business model.

In addition to the sectoral limitations described above, the Group commits not to finance projects

in the Oil \& Gas sector involving new oil extraction sites.

Furthermore, the general exclusion criteria already specified in the "Group Guidelines for the

Governance of Social, Environmental and Governance (ESG) Risks", contextualized and detailed

with respect to the operations of the sector, oblige the Group not to finance projects in the Oil \&

Gas sector characterized by activities with negative environmental impacts in the "critical areas"

of the planet such as:

• natural World Heritage sites (UNESCO)6

• wetlands according to the Ramsar Convention7

• areas designated for the long-term conservation of nature, i.e. those classified by the IUCN,

"International Union for Conservation of Nature", as category I to VI protected areas8

• the Arctic Region9;

• Amazon Sacred Headwaters10.

Finally, the Group commits not to finance companies and projects that, at the time of the

evaluation of the transaction, are located in active armed conflict areas, or when there is

evidence of sanctions, judicial proceedings and sentences relating to violations of human rights

or forced or child labor practices11.

3.2 Exclusions and limitations related to unconventional resources



3.2.1 Exclusions and limitations related to asset management activities



With reference to this activity, the Group will not support counterparties that derive more than 10%

of their revenues from unconventional resources as defined by the following regulations:

• “Sustainable and Responsible Investment Policy” issued by Fideuram Intesa Sanpaolo

Private Banking – SGR Asset management and by Fideuram Asset Management Ireland

dac12;

• "Sustainability Policy" issued by Eurizon Capital Sgr S.P.A (and related subsidiaries)13



6 In particular, reference is made to the areas classified as "Natural" and "Mixed" properties. This is a list of sites officially recognized by

the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). UNESCO World Heritage Sites or their buffer zones are

selected based on cultural, historical, scientific or some other form of significance, and are legally protected by international treaties

(http://whc.unesco.org/en/list ). Where a buffer zone is not determined and the project is located in proximity to a World Heritage Site (i.e.

less than 1 km from its boundary), the Group will decide on a case-by-case basis whether to apply the exclusion criterion.

7 The Ramsar Convention is of international importance and provides the framework for the conservation and prudent use of wetlands

and their resources. Almost 90% of the member states of the United Nations, from all geographical regions of the world, have joined the

Convention by becoming "contracting parties". A key commitment of the contracting parties is to identify and place suitable wetlands on

the List of Wetlands of International Importance, also known as the Ramsar List (http://www.ramsar.org/sites-countries/the-ramsar-sites).

8 This is a list of protected areas that have been identified and classified (from class I to VI) by the International Union for Conservation of

Nature (IUCN), a membership union composed solely of government organizations and civil society organizations.

The categories are defined as follows (https://www.protectedplanet.net/):

- I Strict protection [Ia) Strict nature reserve and Ib) Wilderness area]

- II Conservation and protection of ecosystems (e.g. national park)

- III Conservation of natural features (i.e., natural monument)

- IV Conservation through active management (e.g., Habitat/Species Management Area)

- V Landscape/Seascape Conservation and Restoration (e.g., Protected Landscape/Seascape)

- VI Sustainable use of natural resources (e.g. protected area of managed resources)

9 Area within the Arctic Circle (66.5° north of the Equator)

10 Area intended as the drainage basin of the Amazon River, and the Napo, Pastaza and Marañon rivers

11 In line with the Group's General Governance Principles included in the "Human Rights Principles" and in the "Modern slavery

statement" document

12 For the companies of the Fideuram Intesa Sanpaolo Private Banking - Asset management Group, the restriction applies to all

unconventional resources (for products that do not use a benchmark the exclusion is total while for those that use a benchmark, these

exclusions provide an operational limit, for which the maximum exposure allowed on the issuer is equal to that of the issuer's weight in

the benchmark).

13 The companies of the Eurizon Group apply the exclusions / restrictions for the unconventional resource "oil sands". Exclusions are

applied to all active management products, while in the case of Limited Tracking Error products and index-linked products (with the

factors into the investment process” of the Intesa Sanpaolo Vita Insurance Group14.



3.2.2 Exclusions and limitations related to financing and financial

instruments15



With reference to this activity, the Group commits to:

• not finance projects involving unconventional resource extraction sites;

• not finance counterparties that derive more than 15% of their production revenues from

unconventional resources (targeted financing and generic financing);

• not hold debt and equity securities of counterparties that derive more than 10% of their

production revenues from unconventional resources in the banking book and trading

book16 financial portfolios.

Aware of the role played by the financial system in the fight against climate change, the Group is

also committed to managing outstanding exposures consistently with the "phase-out" as defined

below.



3.3 Phase-out



The Group commits to phase out outstanding exposures subject to the exclusions described in

paragraph 3.2.2 by 2025.



4 RISK ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING



In line with the Group's strategic guidelines and the ESG risk governance framework, Intesa

Sanpaolo pays particular attention to transactions with counterparties operating in the sectors most

exposed to ESG risks. The assessment of these transactions considers specific safeguards within

the credit process, including:

• the ESG \& Reputational risk clearing process;

• the analysis of transition plans;

• the Net-Zero commitment monitoring.

These safeguards apply to operations in the Oil \& Gas sector not subject to specific exclusions and

limitations outlined in these Rules.

4.1 ESG \& Reputational Risk Clearing



The ESG \& Reputational Risk Clearing process provides a comprehensive evaluation of the ESG

and reputational risks associated with credit transactions.



exception of those that specifically integrate ESG factors), the maximum direct investment allowed is equal to the weight of the issuer in

the sustainable benchmark. For issuers with an exposure to the oil sands exploitation sector lower than the established thresholds,

specific engagement processes are activated which may determine restrictions and/or exclusions with respect to the Investment

Universe of the individual assets managed; if at the end of the engagement process no positive effects are found such as, for example,

the definition of "phase-out" plans, the SGR evaluates whether to extend the monitoring period or start the disinvestment process from

the assets managed

14 The companies of the Intesa Sanpaolo Vita Group apply the exclusion to all unconventional resources (tar sands, oil shale, shale gas,

shale oil, coal gas) and to revenues linked to the production of Arctic oil and gas.The Insurance Group promotes proactive interaction with

issuing companies both through the exercise of intervention and voting rights, also through the Delegated Managers, and through

discussions with subsidiaries, encouraging effective communication with the management of companies (so-called "active ownership -

engagement").

15 Included in the banking book and trading book portfolios

16 As regards the trading book portfolio, the scope of application is limited to proprietary investments

Page 7 of 9



With respect to the Oil \& Gas sector, the ESG \& Reputational Risk Clearing process takes into

account the overall complexity of the transaction, thus informing the decision-making process.

This approach is consistent with the Group's objective of limiting or excluding the financing of

activities characterized by a riskier ESG profile, identifying counterparty eligibility criteria in line with

the strategic goals of the Group’s Business Plan. Consequently, high risk transactions that are in

principle not consistent with the Bank's risk appetite, trigger the enhanced assessment process

which requires, among other, the authorization of the Steering Committee, within the relevant

Business Plan and Sustainability (ESG) Session.



4.2 Analysis of transition plans



The analysis of the transition plan enables counterparties’ progress evaluation in achieving set

climate targets. A transition plan must be realistic, comparable with peers’ transition plan, and

consistent with underlying actions necessary to achieve the goals set. From a credit point of view,

the evaluation of the transition plan involves the analysis of potential impacts on economic/financial

and capital soundness of the counterparties.

In particular, the coherence of the counterparties' transition plan and their proactivity in addressing

the challenges that contribute to a low-carbon economy are assessed, through:

• benchmark analysis with peers, the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) targets, and the Net

Zero Banking Alliance goals;

• the robustness of the counterparties’ decarbonization strategy, based on the trends of the

International Energy Agency (IEA), the technologies adopted, and the analysis of the

investments planned by the counterparties;

• the potential impact of the carbon tax on the counterparties’ business profile.

This assessment helps to determine the overall transition risk profile of the operations analyzed as

part of ESG \& Reputational Risk Clearing.

4.3 Commitment to Net Zero



In line with the 2022-2025 Business Plan, the Group is committed to achieving the goals of reducing

financed emissions in the Oil \& Gas sector.

The progressive alignment of the portfolio with climate neutrality targets is performed through the

means of a periodic emission intensity survey of the financed Oil \& Gas sector counterparties,

resulting in the activation of corrective actions and, more generally, portfolio steering.



5 SUSTAINABLE FINANCE



The Group is committed to supporting companies by providing financing aimed at the transition

towards a low-carbon economy, in line with the targets set by the Paris Agreement and subsequent

updates and international commitments.

With this goal, the Group establishes criteria that guarantee such support for those companies in the

sector that are concretely engaged or want to engage in a transition towards sustainable activities

(e.g. energy production from renewable sources).

Consequently, financing aligned with the European taxonomy and classified as sustainable from an

environmental point of view is always permitted, in line with internal classification rules.

6 TRAINING



The Group undertakes to use the available training resources and structures so that its personnel is

given the opportunity to develop the skills required to implement the contents of this document.
