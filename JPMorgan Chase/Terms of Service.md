Climate change is a critical and urgent issue, and addressing it is a global necessity. Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions — the main cause of climate change — will require collective ambition and action across the public andprivate sectors. As a major inter-governmental accord, the Paris Climate Agreement (Paris Agreement or Paris) wasan important step toward that collective ambition — aiming to limit the global average temperature rise to well below2 degrees Celsius, and ideally to 1.5 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels. However, the world is currently noton track to meet these goals.



1 Introduction



JPMorgan Chase committed to and achieved carbon neutralityin our own operations in 2020, expanding on our original pledgeto source renewable energy for 100% of our firm’s global powerneeds. Beyond our operational carbon footprint, we know we havean important role to play in advancing the low-carbon transitionthrough our financing. As a global financial services firm, we dobusiness with companies operating in nearly every sector of theeconomy. We want to use our position to make an impact and helpdrive climate solutions, as do a wide array of our stakeholders —including many of our clients who have announced action plansof their own. We believe that doing more to help them and theeconomy transition from traditional energy sources and developcleaner alternatives is the right thing to do. It isn’t just good forthe planet, it’s good for business and makes us more attractiveto key constituents such as investors, customers and current andprospective employees.This is why, in October 2020, we announced our commitment toalign our financing portfolio with the goals of the Paris Agreement.This means we are measuring the GHG emissions of our clients inkey sectors of our financing portfolio (our ‘financed emissions’)and are setting Paris-aligned emissions reduction targets for thesesector portfolios. We refer to the methodology we have designed forthis commitment as Carbon CompassSM.Going forward, we intend to use our capital and expertise toencourage and help our clients to transition to a low-carbon future.In doing so, we will increasingly support new and existing clientsthat are helping advance the goals of the Paris Agreement andleverage our global scale and reach to try to make a meaningfulcontribution to this effort.

To start, we have developed intermediate Paris-aligned targets toreduce the carbon intensity in our Oil \& Gas, Electric Power andAuto Manufacturing portfolios by 2030. This document sets out ourapproach for doing so, defining the activities and emissions we focuson, the metrics we use and how we track alignment with the ParisAgreement. Our commitment to Paris-alignment is an importantstep toward accelerating the low-carbon energy transition andencouraging near-term actions that will set a path for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.Many groups have developed frameworks to help financialinstitutions align their financing with the Paris Agreement. Ourmethodology was developed by learning from and building on theseexisting approaches, and we are committed to continuously evolvingour approach. In establishing our own methodology, we enlisted thesupport of ERM, a global pure-play sustainability consultancy withdeep sectoral, technical and business expertise in the low-carbonenergy transition, to challenge and enhance our efforts. We believethe approach we have co-developed is practical and future ready,and reflects leading thinking on Paris alignment. We are making thedetails of our methodology public to help advance efforts across ourindustry and to bring our clients along on our journey to help meetthe goals of the Paris Agreement.

1.1. Key Elements of Our Approach



Science-based: To align our selected portfolios with the goalsof the Paris Agreement, JPMorgan Chase has adopted theInternational Energy Agency’s (IEA) World Energy Outlook(WEO) Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) as of October2020 (IEA SDS), which limits warming to 1.65°C with a 50%probability, as a primary reference. The targets we have setbuild on the transition pathways outlined in the IEA SDS, alongwith a wide range of public resources, including additionalclimate scenarios, decarbonization research and otherframeworks for assessing Paris alignment.

Sector-specific: One of our central choices was to developmetrics and targets tailored to individual sectors, recognizingthat each sector faces unique challenges. Within a givensector we have focused on specific activities with materialemissions and credible transition pathways. By incorporatingthese factors into our approach, we are able to gain moreuseful insight and better support our clients in developingand implementing their strategies. For details on why we arefocusing on Oil \& Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing,see section 1.2 below.



Decision-useful metrics: For each sector, we defineone or more core metrics that capture essential factsabout companies’ performance and progress towardsdecarbonization, and that are compatible with the benchmarktrajectories we use to evaluate Paris alignment. This enablesmeasurable tracking and comparison of performance on anongoing basis. That, in turn, will inform how we engage clientsand make financing decisions at the company and portfoliolevel. For more information on how we developed metrics foreach sector, see section 1.5 below.

Best available data: Our metrics are designed to make useof consistent, well-reported and standardized data. However,more and better data is still needed. In particular, improvedcompany- and activity-level emissions data will enhancethe ability to measure results, track progress and driveaccountability in a concerted way, enabling financial markets tomake more informed decisions about climate risk. Where gapsin the data exist today, we have established a detailed processfor using the best available alternative data. We are activelysupporting improved measurement and better disclosureof data, and plan to update our methodology to reflectimprovements over time.

To evaluate Paris alignment of JPMorgan Chase’s global financing portfolio in each of the included sectors, we compute a portfolio-weightedaverage of emissions performance for all our clients in the sector portfolio. Weights are determined based on our cumulative financingto each client as a share of our total financing to the sector. We include both financing that we directly provide (such as through revolvingcredit facilities) as well as our share of facilitated financing (such as through our underwriting in debt and equity capital markets). The vastmajority of this activity occurs in our Corporate and Investment Bank and Commercial Banking lines of business. In the case of revolving creditfacilities, financing amounts reflect the total limit of available credit outstanding, not just the drawn amount. We also include our tax-orientedinvestments, which are largely concentrated in the Electric Power sector.

Our Carbon Compass methodology incorporates, but also expands upon, existing approaches to define robust, decision-useful metrics and science-based targets on a sector-by-sector basis. The following highlights several key choices and considerations in how we designed our approach.

1.2. Sector Focus



WHY WE CHOSE TO USE CARBON INTENSITY METRICS



For the three selected sectors currentlyincluded in our Carbon Compassmethodology — Oil \& Gas, Electric Powerand Auto Manufacturing — we have chosencarbon intensity as our primary metric,which measures emissions relative to agiven unit of output (e.g., kilogram CO2 permegawatt hour of electricity generation).Carbon intensity metrics will most effectivelyenable us to evaluate performance at thesector and the company level, inform ourengagement with our clients and makecapital allocation decisions. Evaluatingchanges in performance is crucial in aneconomy that needs to meet the Parisobjectives while still generating energy forthe world’s growing needs.

More specifically, carbon intensity is decision-useful and impact-oriented because it:

Allows us to set informative targets that are aligned with science-based scenarios, whichrequire constraining total emissions on a pathway that ultimately achieves net-zero

Enables us to meaningfully engage with new and existing clients and provide thecapital necessary to help finance their transition, while reducing the carbon intensityof our portfolio

It is estimated that$100–150 trillionwill be needed globally over the next 30 years to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goals1



Enables us to evaluate both individual companies’ and whole sectors’ performance againstdecarbonization trajectories that must be achieved to align with the Paris Agreement

More effectively reflects the progress that high-emitting companies and sectors aremaking in transitioning to lower-carbon production and products

Allows for easier comparison across a portfolio of companies within a sector andbetween companies of different sizes

Is less affected than absolute emissions by year-to-year emissions volatility, such aschanges in companies’ production

To start, JPMorgan Chase has developed targets to reduce thecarbon intensity of our global Oil \& Gas, Electric Power and AutoManufacturing portfolios. We chose these sectors for severalreasons. First, each represents a significant share of global GHGemissions. Second, viable transition pathways exist and are alreadybeing pursued by many companies in these sectors. Third, althoughimprovements are still needed, there is sufficient data emergingfor estimating each of these sectors’ emissions performance andcomparing it to a suitable Paris-aligned emissions reduction trajectory.Additionally, these three sectors are key elements of the primary,secondary and end use segments of the energy value chain, andinteractions among them are important to overall decarbonization.In primary energy, the world needs to reduce reliance on fossil fuelsincluding oil and natural gas. Secondary energy providers (electric

power companies) need to shift to renewable and low-carbonalternatives, and end use sectors such as Auto Manufacturing needto transition from developing products that rely on hydrocarbon-based primary energy sources to cleaner secondary energy sources,including electricity. According to IEA’s most recent analyses, based on2018 data, electricity and heat production account for approximately44% of global CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, the vast majorityof which is attributable to power generation.2 Similarly, transportationis responsible for 26% of direct CO2 emissions from fuel combustion,nearly three quarters of which is from road vehicles.3

By initially focusing on the Oil \& Gas, Electric Power and AutoManufacturing sectors, our methodology recognizes key dependenciesthat will be crucial to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.

1.2.1 SECTOR-SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES AND EMISSIONS INCLUDED



The following highlights key aspects of the methodology for each of the three initial sectors we are focusing on:



Oil \& Gas — We have established distinct metrics and targetsfor Operational emissions from production and refining (Scopes1 and 2) and End Use emissions from the combustion of oiland natural gas (Scope 3). This approach acknowledges thatboth Operational and End Use emissions are important to thesector’s climate impact, and that there is a particular needto address operational methane emissions in the near term.Unburned methane that is leaked or vented has over twenty-five times the global warming potential of CO2. In addition,methane is natural gas, itself a saleable, productive energyproduct, making its loss through leaks, venting or flaring anegative business and environmental impact.



Electric Power — We focus on direct CO2 emissions from powergeneration (Scope 1), which account for the vast majority of thesector’s climate impact. The methodology is designed to trackthe fuel mix of power generation activities as it shifts from beingpredominantly fossil-based to more reliant on renewables, in abid to rapidly decarbonize electricity grids globally.

Auto Manufacturing — We measure direct emissions fromauto manufacturing (Scopes 1 and 2) as well as “tank-to-wheel”emissions from vehicle end use (Scope 3). In addition to globalpassenger car sales, our methodology also includes U.S. sales oflight trucks (SUVs, vans and pickups), as these are primarily soldas passenger vehicles and can account for as much as 30% ofglobal sales for some portfolio companies.

Over time, we intend to expand Carbon Compass to address additional sectors, and we aim to extend and improve its application in accordancewith best practices and improved data availability. For more information on the next steps associated with this commitment, see p. 23.

1.3. Our 2030 Global Portfolio Emissions Reduction Targets

The table below summarizes the current portfolio-weighted average carbon intensity of JPMorgan Chase’s in-scope clients and the interimtargets we have defined for 2030 for each sector, which are aligned to the goals of the Paris Agreement. For more information on eachsector’s target, including the scenario and methods used, the emissions included and other details, see descriptions of the sector-specificmethodologies beginning on p. 10.

The values above are based on available data and scenario projections as of April 2021. Future updates to the IEA SDS scenario and/or otherinputs — for example, to reflect changes in global emissions, available technologies or economic conditions — may result in changes to therequired Paris-aligned trajectories, and therefore our targets for these sectors. Improving visibility, quality and availability of data may alsonecessitate a restatement of our 2019 baseline for one or more of the included sectors. We will regularly monitor these changes and assessthe appropriateness of recalibrating our metrics and targets.

Going forward, we intend to align our lending and underwritingdecisions in our chosen sectors to work towards achieving ourportfolio targets. That means we will increasingly support thosecompanies that are helping to advance the goals of the ParisAgreement, such as by expanding their investment in low- andzero-carbon energy sources and technologies and reducing theirGHG emissions.Significant amounts of capital and strategic advice will be needed tosupport companies in their low-carbon transition efforts, includinghelp to decarbonize their operations and products and develop newtechnologies and solutions to address the critical challenges climatechange presents. As a global financial services company, and oneof the largest financiers to many sectors that will be significantlyimpacted by climate change and the energy transition, we are well-positioned to use our capital and expertise to encourage and helpour clients to make the transition.With our sector-specific and global portfolio-level commitment design,we are positioned to understand the unique challenges that eachsector — and each company — faces in the low-carbon transition and

to provide targeted support. We will continually look for opportunitiesto engage with new clients and to bank new sectors and technologiesthat focus on sustainability and low-carbon transition. We alsorecognize that — for both our clients and our own portfolios — thepathway of forward-looking targets is unlikely to be linear, as thetrajectory of transition for most companies will be driven by factorssuch as major technological breakthroughs.We will also take into account emissions performance metricsand stated targets in how we evaluate and make decisions aboutfinancing clients in our chosen sectors. This includes evaluatingseveral key factors, including our clients’ own forward-lookingtransition-related commitments, business strategies and capitalplanning. We believe our biggest impact comes from engaging withclients in these industries to inform their strategic and financialdecisions. Our preference will always be to help companiestransition; however, if needed, we will also consider reallocatingcapital so that our global sector portfolios in our chosen sectors arealigned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

1.4. How We Will Use Our Targets

Carbon Compass incorporates what we believe are the most relevant, impactful, credible and decision-useful data and metrics to driveprogress. As noted above, one of the essential features of our approach is the use of a tailored methodology for each included sector. Thefollowing summarizes the process we use, including key considerations at each step, and outlines the general framework for the sector-specific methodologies described in the remainder of this document.



8Carbon CompassSM : Paris-Aligned Financing Commitment Methodology

Define sector activities, emissions and financing in scope. Tobe effective, our metrics and targets are based on the activitiesthat generate the most GHG emissions for each sector and that aremost important for each company’s transition pathway. Therefore,our approach to each sector begins with careful consideration ofkey business activities and emissions drivers, available transitionpathways, industry trends, regulatory context, key dependenciesand our portfolio. This approach results in an initial definition of theactivities, emissions and financing we want to track, which are keyinputs for developing metrics and determining how to align them tothe goals of the Paris Agreement. For example, for the Power sector,we decided to focus on direct emissions from power generation as itmost closely aligns with the decarbonization trajectory of the sector.

Develop decision-useful emissions metric(s). Once key activitiesand emissions are defined, we work to develop one or more metricsfor measuring and tracking emissions performance of our clientcompanies and our portfolio as a whole. We begin by assessingavailable tools and approaches, including commonly used metrics,as well as available data sources and potential tradeoffs betweendifferent approaches. While our goal is to use standardized data andmetrics where possible, in some cases we have chosen to combinemultiple approaches and/or datasets in order to create a more robust,decision-useful metric. For example, for the Oil \& Gas sector, wedecided to track both Operational and End Use emissions performance,which then led to a decision to develop two distinct metrics.



Determine appropriate emissions trajectory. After metrics arechosen, we then determine how to align them to a Paris-alignedemissions reduction scenario. This process involves selecting ascenario for which appropriate, sector-specific projections areprovided or can be reasonably extrapolated. In some cases, it isnecessary to make strategic choices or adjustments to account foradditional emissions included in our metrics. For example, for ourAuto Manufacturing sector methodology, it was necessary to adoptan alternative scenario, which for this sector, is similar to the IEASDS, and adjust for the inclusion of U.S. light trucks in addition toglobal passenger cars. After a scenario is selected and applied, theoutput is a Paris-aligned benchmark emissions trajectory for thechosen sector and performance metric.

Derive 2030 portfolio target(s). Using the benchmark emissionstrajectory, we then derive where our global sector portfolio needsto be in 2030 in order to be considered Paris-aligned. Dependingon the granularity of available scenario projections, the target maybe expressed as a specific carbon intensity value or it may be apercentage reduction from a specified baseline. We have adoptedtargets from existing global scenarios that are Paris-aligned.

Reassess as emissions trajectories change and new databecomes available. Emissions scenarios, like those in IEA’sWorld Energy Outlook, are usually updated on an annual basis, toreflect both relevant changes in the energy picture (e.g., availabletechnologies, anticipated costs, new public policies) and currentglobal energy and emissions trends. Subsequent updates maytherefore lead to changes in the required trajectories aligned withthe Paris Agreement, which may then necessitate updating ourportfolio targets. At the same time, new or better data may becomeavailable for some sectors, which may create opportunities toincorporate additional emissions and/or improve the rigor of ourchosen metrics. Therefore, a key step for each sector methodologyis to periodically reassess key inputs and assumptions, and torecalibrate our targets as needed.



9Carbon CompassSM : Paris-Aligned Financing Commitment Methodology

Combustion of fossil fuels is the primary driver of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and resulting climate change. Energy use — mostof which is currently fossil fuel-based — is estimated to account for approximately 78% of global man-made greenhouse gas emissions.4 Thus,as society accelerates efforts to decarbonize, it will need to reduce its reliance on fossil-based energy resources. To be a part of a low-carbonfuture, the Oil \& Gas sector will need to transform and innovate, which will require substantial capital and strategic support. This is a keyreason why JPMorgan Chase’s Carbon Compass includes the sector.



2 Oil \& Gas



Most emissions reduction scenarios, including the IEA SDS, assume arole for oil and natural gas well into the transition required to meetthe goals of the Paris Agreement (see adjoining figure). However, asgovernments, communities, investors and other industries pursueenergy transition, there is growing pressure for the Oil \& Gas sectorto adapt to declining demand for its core products and shift its focusto supporting and capitalizing on development of a low-carbonenergy system.At the same time, there are concerns about the sector’s directemissions from the production of oil and natural gas that willstill occur on the path to net-zero emissions. These includeemissions associated with extraction, refining and transport and,in particular, the release of methane. While the scope and scaleof these emissions vary by source and production method, theyare significant. IEA’s analysis, completed as part of the 2018 WorldEnergy Outlook, showed Operational emissions represent between10% and 30% of total lifecycle carbon intensity for oil and between15% and 40% for natural gas.5

These challenges set the context and define two key objectives fordecarbonization of the Oil \& Gas sector: (1) reducing Operational CO2

and methane emissions from oil and natural gas operations; and (2)reducing End Use carbon emissions by transitioning to renewablesand other forms of low-carbon energy. Strategic options will varydepending on a given company’s position in the value chain, progressalready made in confronting the challenge and viability of availablepathways. For example, to reduce Operational emissions, companiesinvolved in upstream production and processing segments can

2.1. Key Decisions

To assess the alignment of JPMorgan Chase’s Oil \& Gas portfolio withthe Paris Agreement, we evaluate both Operational (Scope 1 and 2)and End Use (combustion-related Scope 3) emissions performanceof production and/or refining activities. Emissions performance ismeasured on an intensity basis and benchmarked to targets derivedfrom the energy pathways published as part of the IEA SDS. Bytracking both of these values, our approach is consistent with thestrategies that oil and gas companies are using to decarbonize theirbusinesses, and it provides a framework for engaging with them ontheir commitments and targets.A key element of our approach to Operational emissions isrecognition of the need for a rapid decline in fugitive and ventedmethane emissions and CO2 from flaring. IEA analysis consistent withSDS suggests the need for a 75% reduction in methane emissions, a90% reduction in CO2 emissions from flaring and a 15% reduction inCO2 emissions from all other activities and processes between 2019and 2030. This framework is applied to our portfolio to derive our2030 reduction target of 35% for Operational carbon intensity from a2019 baseline.Our 2030 target for End Use carbon intensity is a 15% reduction,measured from a 2019 baseline, which reflects a decline in oil andgas demand and associated emissions under the IEA SDS by 2030, aswell as rising demand for renewable energy. Through 2030, the IEASDS includes a 13% decrease in CO2 emissions from oil and naturalgas use as a result of shifts away from oil and toward natural gas,as well as a nearly 8% drop in global oil and gas demand. Over thesame period, demand for bioenergy and non-hydro renewable energyunder the IEA SDS increases by 50%. These analyses reflect the needfor companies in the Oil \& Gas sector to transition from production ofhigh-carbon fuels to low- and zero-carbon sources of energy.Our approach is also adaptable to the different business modelswithin the sector. Depending on the nature of a given company —e.g., whether it is integrated, with operations across the value chain,or focused on specific segments such as production or refining— the emissions sources and range of available and appropriate

decarbonization strategies vary significantly. Yet, even as we supportunique strategies at the company level, our metrics and targetswill help us maintain a holistic view of the industry and how eachcompany’s approach fits within that picture.

invest to reduce venting and flaring of methane and switch tolower-carbon energy sources for production equipment. Companieswith refining operations can work to reduce process-related CO2

emissions. Companies can also reduce Operational carbon emissionsby investing in carbon removal strategies such as carbon capture andstorage, direct air capture or nature-based solutions and retainingownership of or retiring carbon reduction credits.

To reduce End Use emissions, companies can produce energy withlower- or zero carbon content (e.g., renewables, biofuels, hydrogen)and reduce production of energy products with higher carboncontent, which both responds to and supports other sectors’ shifttoward lower-carbon energy sources. Companies can also reduce EndUse emissions by investing in removal strategies and transferringcredits to customers or retiring credits on behalf of customers.

2.2. Boundaries

For evaluation of Operational emissions performance, themethodology captures all Scope 1 and 2 emissions, includingmethane, associated with the production and refining of oil,natural gas liquids, natural gas, biofuels and other low-carbonfuels such as hydrogen.For End Use, the methodology captures Scope 3 CO2 emissionsfrom the combustion of energy produced by oil and gascompanies. Depending on a company’s operations, energyproducts may include natural gas, unrefined liquids products(e.g., crude oil) and refined liquids (e.g., gasoline, diesel). Themethodology assumes no End Use emissions from the use ofbioenergy, hydrogen or renewable electricity. Scope 3 supply chainemissions are not included as these are negligible and do notcontribute to the focus on products combusted for energy use.As noted above, the methodology does not currently includetransportation of oil and natural gas products, as data quality isa particular challenge for this segment of the industry. We plan

to work with companies with transportation operations, industrytrade groups and data providers to incorporate the segment intothe methodology in the future.The methodology currently allows all types of company-implemented carbon removals — including carbon capture, use andstorage (CCS/CCUS), direct air capture and nature-based solutions— to be credited against company emissions, provided that they areproperly attributed according to standard GHG accounting protocols.The methodology also allows crediting of reductions associatedwith company-implemented or third-party carbon removal projectsthat have been validated and registered on an eligible platform.Additionally, the methodology allows renewable energy credits(RECs) to be credited against Scope 2 emissions from purchasedelectricity. At this time, the methodology does not give credit forother company-implemented or third-party reduction projects, suchas for avoided emissions. We recognize that this is an evolving spaceand remain committed to considering other crediting mechanismsas technology and protocols evolve.

JPMorgan Chase’s Paris commitment for the Oil \& Gas sector is initially focused on all portfolio companies that are involved in production and/or refining activities. This includes both pure-play exploration and production (E\&P) and refining companies, integrated majors, nationally-owned oil companies, as well as diversified companies with oil and gas activities. Production of low-carbon fuels, such as biofuels or hydrogen,and generation of renewable electricity by oil and gas companies are also included. As more data becomes available, we also plan to extend thecommitment to include oil and natural gas transportation.

2.3. Metrics

JPMorgan Chase’s Oil \& Gas sector methodology includes two calculatedcarbon intensity values to assess Paris alignment and provide a clearline of sight to the climate-related priorities of our clients:

1. Operational carbon intensity — expressed as grams CO2eper megajoule (g CO2e/MJ) of embedded energy — to trackreduction in methane and CO2 emissions from operations2. End Use carbon intensity — expressed as grams CO2 permegajoule (g CO2/MJ) of embedded energy — to track thetransition to low- and zero-carbon energy, such as bioenergyand renewables

The Operational carbon intensity metric is calculated as CO2 andmethane emissions divided by energy embedded in natural gas, oiland bioenergy that is produced. For oil refineries, refinery throughputis used in the denominator. The End Use carbon intensity metric iscalculated as the emissions resulting from combustion of naturalgas, oil and refined products divided by the energy embedded inthese products, as well as advanced low-carbon fuels (e.g., biofuels,hydrogen) and renewable electricity that oil and gas companies havestarted to develop.By tracking these values both at the company and portfolio level, wewill gain added insight and a means to align our financing with theindustry-wide strategic imperatives created by the energy transition.

JPMorgan Chase uses the assumptions and data associated with the IEA SDS to define a benchmark trajectory and 2030 targets for our Oil \&Gas sector portfolio. We selected this scenario because it is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, it is updated on a regular basis andit is associated with detailed emissions and energy demand projections for oil and natural gas as a share of the overall energy mix. Using thisbenchmark, and the composition of our portfolio, we calculate IEA SDS-aligned rates of change and resulting g CO2e/MJ and g CO2/MJ targetsfor the Operational and End Use carbon intensities, respectively.

This results in a 2030 portfolio rate of change target of 35%,which is a slightly lower percentage than the overall carbonintensity reduction published by the IEA. The difference is drivenby our analysis that the companies in our portfolio have loweraverage operating emissions than the global average. However, werecognize the importance of a focused effort to reduce methaneemissions and reduce flaring and venting in the oil and natural gasindustry, which is why we have set a target that is appropriatelychallenging for ourselves and for our clients. This rate of reductiontarget will be applied to JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 global portfolioOperational carbon intensity of 6.1 g CO2e/MJ.The End Use carbon intensity benchmark and target are calculatedusing carbon dioxide emissions and embedded energy from theIEA SDS for 2019 and 2030. As of April 2021, this results in a rateof change of 15%, which is then applied to JPMorgan Chase’s 2019global portfolio End Use carbon intensity of 66.5 g CO2/MJ.

We intend to review the IEA’s World Energy Outlook projectionseach year and assess the appropriateness of recalibrating ouradopted benchmark targets.We recognize that the use of target rates of change appliedto carbon intensity metrics could, in theory, become quicklydisconnected from necessary reductions in absolute emissions —for example, if overall oil and natural gas demand remains higherthan assumed when the targets were calculated. We remain opento recalibrating our targets if subsequent updates to IEA SDS resultin a more stringent reduction pathway.

2.5. Data Sources and Considerations

JPMorgan Chase has decided to use upstream oil and natural gas andrefining data collected and maintained by the energy and resourcesconsultancy Wood Mackenzie (WoodMac) to compute our clients’carbon intensity. Production and refining data from WoodMac usesthe net working interest method of aggregating asset-level (field- orrefinery-level) data up to the parent. Additional sources includingdirect company disclosures and syndicated databases are alsoused to collect and verify specific data points for our model. Forcompanies not adequately covered by these sources, we use proxyvalues equivalent to the 75th percentile of the available data forother portfolio companies, based on the type of operations.Data quality and reliability is a well-known challenge for the Oil\& Gas sector. This arises from inconsistencies in measurement,management and reporting of data across the industry, as well asthe lack of reliable and standardized techniques for measurementin areas such as methane. Although the situation is graduallyimproving, it remains a key concern of industry groups, NGOs andother stakeholders engaged in efforts to decarbonize the sector,and it was an important consideration in how our Oil \& Gas sectormethodology was formulated.

Currently, reported methane emissions data often relies on inferencemethods. JPMorgan Chase is committed to working with industrypartners and NGOs to help make direct measurement technologiesthe preferred method of tracking and reporting methane emissions.This should materially improve the quality of data available. We willcontinue to incorporate best available methane emissions data, givenits environmental importance and the industry’s focus on the issue.Having identified that the production of biofuels and the useof carbon credits are key elements of the sector’s overalldecarbonization strategy, we have incorporated them in themethodology despite the unavailability of consistent data today.We will continue to engage with our Oil \& Gas portfolio companiesand work with other industry stakeholders to improve dataavailability and reliability. Over time, we expect that increasedconsistency in approaches to measure and report emissions willlead to advances that we can incorporate into our Carbon Compassmethodology.

Electric power generation is an important focus of our efforts to address climate change. Globally, power generation is the single largest usefor fossil fuels and thus a central source of climate-altering emissions. Moreover, electrification is a key part of strategies for decarbonizingother sectors responsible for significant emissions, including transportation, industry and buildings. As a result, demand for electricity isalready growing faster than that for other forms of energy, and electricity is expected to meet an increased share of global energy needsthrough 2030 and beyond (see figure below). Decarbonizing the sector is important — because, if overall demand grows and decarbonizationproceeds too slowly, then the sector’s emissions could continue to increase.



3 Electric Power



Today, the Electric Power sector producessignificant emissions due to continuedreliance on fossil fuels, especially coal.Decarbonization therefore hinges onaccelerating deployment of renewableand other low-carbon generating capacity,both to meet new demand and ultimatelydisplace legacy fossil-fired sources. Overtime, technologies such as energy storage,smart grids and carbon capture are alsolikely to play an important role in improvingthe sector’s performance.Navigating this transition will requiresignificant investment and innovativefinancing solutions to support newinfrastructure, drive development andcommercialization of new technologies,manage risk and improve cost-effectiveness.

3.2. Boundaries

For the purposes of our Carbon Compass methodology, the ElectricPower sector consists of all portfolio companies that are engagedin electricity generation. This includes both public and investor-owned utility companies, independent power producers, electriccooperatives, as well as diversified companies with power generationactivities.To evaluate the sector’s performance, we measure companies’direct Scope 1 carbon emissions from power generation. Thisallows us to concentrate on the part of the value chain responsible

for the overwhelming majority of the sector’s emissions and thuswhere the greatest amount of strategic focus and investmentare required. In comparison, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions forcompanies that generate electricity are generally relatively minorand/or do not relate directly to power generation. Focusing on directScope 1 emissions is also consistent with the modeling approachin IEA’s World Energy Outlook projections, which allows for directcomparison of our portfolio with IEA benchmark scenario data.

To assess Paris alignment of JPMorgan Chase’s Electric Powerportfolio, we evaluate direct Scope 1 CO2 emissions for companiesgenerating electricity. This enables us to focus directly on the sector’score business activity and the primary driver of its GHG emissions.Emissions performance is measured on a carbon intensity basis —kilograms (kg) CO2 per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated— and benchmarked to the sector-specific energy and emissionspathways published as part of IEA SDS. Using currently available dataand assumptions, this results in a 2030 portfolio target of 115.4 kgCO2/MWh, which represents a 69% reduction from our 2019 portfoliobaseline of 375.6 kg CO2/MWh.As with our approach to other sectors, our target is pegged to whatthe IEA SDS scenario defines as necessary to align with the goals ofthe Paris Agreement, and we will continually evaluate and recalibratethe target as the scenario is updated and/or new data becomesavailable, generally on an annual basis.Furthermore, our 2030 target is derived from the IEA SDS pathwayfor OECD countries, which implies more stringent (i.e., lower) carbonintensities than the non-OECD or overall World pathways. We chosethis both because the current geographic distribution of our Powersector portfolio is largely comprised of companies in OECD countriesand because we believe it is important to set a high bar for overallperformance between now and 2030.



16Carbon CompassSM : Paris-Aligned Financing Commitment Methodology

3.3. Metric

We use a carbon intensity metric — kilograms (kg) CO2 permegawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated — to evaluate thealignment of our Electric Power portfolio with the Paris Agreement.



Σ kg CO2 (from power generation)



Σ MWh of electricity



An intensity-based metric is particularly well suited to the ElectricPower sector because it captures a wide range of fuel mixes andtechnology solutions and their impact on emissions performance overtime. An intensity-based metric also allows for more consistent trackingand comparison between companies without the need for complexmethods to allocate shares of absolute emissions or adjust for marketvolatility or other changes unrelated to emissions performance.

3.4. Scenario and Target

Our Carbon Compass methodology uses the IEA SDS to setbenchmark targets for JPMorgan Chase’s Electric Power portfolio.This scenario was selected for several reasons. First, it is alignedto the goals of the Paris Agreement, meaning that it assumes anappropriate transition of the global energy system in order tolimit the increase in global average temperature to well below2°C above pre-industrial levels. Second, it is updated on a regularbasis, ensuring that it keeps pace with available data, emissionstrends and scientific understanding of the climate challenge.Third, it corresponds to detailed World Energy Outlook projectionsfor electricity generation by geography, technology and fueltype, thereby enabling us to calculate average carbon intensitiescorresponding to a Paris-aligned benchmark trajectory for the sector.Under the SDS scenario, IEA projects electricity generation levelsfor future years on a country and regional basis. This includes

decarbonization pathways for three broad regions: OECD, Non-OECDand World. Projections for the OECD region imply substantiallymore stringent (i.e., lower) carbon intensities than those for non-OECD countries, reflecting the expectation that OECD countries willtransition more aggressively in the near term.Considering the current geographic distribution of companies inJPMorgan Chase’s Electric Power sector portfolio, we have chosento use a single benchmark aligned to the OECD trajectory. Thiseffectively sets a higher standard of performance than if we used ablended benchmark. Using this trajectory, we then derive a Paris-aligned portfolio intensity target for 2030. Based on IEA’s currentprojections for the OECD region, this target is 115.4 kg CO2/MWh.We intend to review the IEA’s World Energy Outlook projections eachyear and assess the appropriateness of recalibrating our adoptedbenchmark targets.

3.5. Data Sources and Considerations

To calculate the carbon intensity of companies in JPMorgan Chase’sElectric Power sector portfolio, we use generation data sourcedfrom S\&P Trucost and apply emissions factors based on fuel typeand region that are derived from IEA World Energy Outlook data.If generation data is unavailable, we use installed capacity fromS\&P SNL Financial and estimated carbon intensity by applyingaverage utilization rates, based on fuel type and region, and theaforementioned emissions factors. As part of our review process, weintend to reassess the emissions factors’ continued appropriatenesswhen applied at the individual company level.For a very small proportion of companies in our portfolio for whichno data is available, a default carbon intensity based on a relativelyconservative fuel mix that is equal parts coal and natural gas will

be assigned, unless the company’s NAICS codes indicate it to be azero-emitting power producer, in which case it is assigned a carbonintensity of zero.We acknowledge that such proxy methods are subject to limitationsin the assumptions and data used to apply them and therefore thatcompanies’ actual performance may differ from our estimates.JPMorgan Chase will continue to work with companies and otherstakeholders to improve overall quality and availability of data.We will also continually review and assess the need to update and/or strengthen our approach to estimation, both when new WorldEnergy Outlook projections are released and as general dataavailability improves.



18Carbon CompassSM : Paris-Aligned Financing Commitment Methodology

According to 2018 IEA data, transportation is responsible for 26% of direct CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, nearly three quarters ofwhich is from road vehicles.7 Although automotive efficiency is improving, global vehicle sales continue to grow and buyers in many marketscontinue to shift toward larger, heavier vehicles such as SUVs — trends that can slow or limit gains in overall emissions performance.8Continued decarbonization of the sector is therefore a significant global priority and a key part of the energy transition necessary to limitclimate change.



4 Auto Manufacturing



Transition strategies for the automotive sector generally call for:(1) increased efficiency of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles;(2) conversion of a significant portion of the fleet to electric vehicles(EVs); (3) further decarbonization of the electric grid; and (4)increased utilization and/or reduced per capita vehicle miles traveledthrough strategies including demand management and modal shift(e.g., from private to public transport).Auto manufacturers contribute most directly to the first two strategiesabove. Namely, as companies’ sales of more efficient ICE vehiclesand EVs increase, the average carbon intensity of their fleets decline,indicating progress toward Paris alignment in terms of technologydeployment. This is precisely the pathway for the Auto Manufacturingsector that many emissions-reduction scenarios envision, as theyassume increasing electrification to 2030 and beyond.

In recent years, some leading auto manufacturers have embraced the goal of either partial or total electrification and announced increasinglyambitious plans to shift their product portfolios accordingly. This approach has been driven by numerous factors including regulation,technological advances and competition. Yet, even as these forces strengthen, shifting the course of the entire global auto industry will be ahuge undertaking. New and further investments in technology, manufacturing, infrastructure and services will be required, and these changeswill have to coincide with equally massive transitions in other parts of the economy — including the Electric Power and Oil \& Gas sectors. This isone reason why Auto Manufacturing is one of the first three sectors included in Carbon Compass, and why we are working to support clients inall three sectors as they develop and implement their transition strategies.



19Carbon CompassSM : Paris-Aligned Financing Commitment Methodology

4.1. Key Decisions

To assess the Paris alignment of JPMorgan Chase’s AutoManufacturing portfolio, we evaluate carbon intensity of globalsales of new passenger cars and U.S. sales of light trucks (e.g., SUVs,vans, pickups). Both manufacturing emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) andemissions from the end use of vehicles (Scope 3) are included. Theinclusion of U.S. light truck sales is a key decision, as most of thesevehicles are used as passenger vehicles and they can account for upto 30% of global sales for some portfolio companies.The Auto Manufacturing sector methodology uses an intensity-based metric of sales-weighted average grams of carbon dioxideequivalent (CO2e) emissions per kilometer for new vehicles sold —g CO2e/km — which provides a clear indication of decarbonizationperformance over time.To benchmark alignment with the Paris Agreement, ourmethodology uses the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP)Beyond 2°C scenario (B2DS) as adapted by the Science-BasedTargets initiative’s (SBTi) guidance for the Transport sector. Usingthis trajectory, we have established a 2030 Auto Manufacturingsector portfolio intensity target of 92.3 g CO2e/km, representing a41% reduction from our 2019 baseline of 157.8 g CO2e/km.

4.2. Boundaries

For purposes of the Carbon Compass methodology, JPMorgan Chase’sAuto Manufacturing sector portfolio includes companies that sellpassenger vehicles anywhere in the world.To evaluate companies’ performance, we focus on emissionsassociated with global sales of new passenger cars and U.S. sales oflight trucks (SUVs, vans, pickups). We include U.S. light trucks bothbecause they account for a significant share (approximately 50%9)of total U.S. passenger vehicle sales and because of differences inhow they are regulated in the U.S. versus other global markets (i.e.,as passenger versus commercial vehicles).Given significantly greater market and regulatory complexity, andlimitations on available data, we currently do not evaluate portfoliocompanies that exclusively sell medium- and heavy-duty commercialvehicles, nor do we include any companies’ sales of commercialvehicles. We will continue to evaluate how we might include thesecompanies and/or vehicle types in the future.

For passenger vehicles included, we evaluate “tank-to-wheel”(i.e., tailpipe) emissions from vehicle use (Scope 3 — end use)and emissions from manufacturing (Scopes 1 and 2). The focuson end use emissions from companies’ new passenger vehiclesales reflects that these represent the largest share of the sector’soverall emissions. We do not currently include emissions from theproduction and delivery of the energy used by vehicles (Scope 3 —fuel production). This omission keeps the Auto Manufacturing sectormetric focused on the vehicles that they are producing, while alsoreflecting that JPMorgan Chase’s Carbon Compass already coversthe Oil \& Gas and Electric Power sectors, which provide fuel for ICEsand EVs, respectively.

20Carbon CompassSM : Paris-Aligned Financing Commitment Methodology

We also do not currently include emissions “embedded” in parts andmaterials that manufacturers purchase from third parties (Scope 3— supply chain). This choice results from insufficient supply chainreporting by manufacturers. However, we recognize that embeddedmanufacturing emissions are material to comprehensive assessmentof the Auto Manufacturing sector’s Paris alignment, especially asEVs — whose supply chain emissions are approximately doublethose for ICEs, primarily due to battery production — make up agrowing share of total sales. To address this gap, when evaluatingindividual auto companies, we will collect and qualitatively analyze

manufacturer data on supply chain plans and goals, particularlyas they relate to efforts toward reducing emissions from batterymanufacturing. We will also continue to evaluate how we mightinclude supply chain emissions in the future, when the required datais available.Both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions include CO2, methane(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, as reported by automanufacturers. Scope 3 emissions include only CO2, whichdominates tailpipe emissions.

4.3. Metric

To evaluate Auto Manufacturing companies’ alignment with the ParisAgreement, we use the intensity-based metric of sales-weightedaverage grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions perkilometer for new cars sold, or g CO2e/km. As noted above, ourcalculation combines emissions from manufacturing (Scopes 1 and 2)with “tank-to-wheel” (TTW) emissions (Scope 3 — end use). To calculateScopes 1 and 2 emissions per kilometer driven, vehicles are assumedto have 150,000 km of vehicle life — equivalent to approximately 11years of driving, measured on a global average basis.

This intensity-based approach is particularly useful for evaluatingcompanies’ performance on a continuous basis and effectivelyincorporating end use emissions, which account for the majority ofthe sector’s climate-related impact. The metric also provides themost flexible means of tracking progress on the sector’s two keystrategies for decarbonization: improving efficiency of ICE vehiclesand increasing adoption of EVs.

4.4. Scenario and Target

The Paris-aligned benchmark trajectory for JPMorgan Chase’sAuto Manufacturing sector portfolio is based on the IEA ETPB2DS as adapted and applied by SBTi’s Sector DecarbonizationApproach (SDA) Transport tool. The B2DS scenario is broadlysimilar to the IEA SDS scenario used for our Oil \& Gas and ElectricPower sector methodologies. However, we could not use the SDSdirectly because IEA does not publish the detailed SDS modelingresults that would be needed to derive relevant portfolio targetsfor the Auto Manufacturing sector. In contrast, the SBTi SDATransport tool’s refinement of B2DS scenario enables us to derivethe necessary targets, particularly those applicable to passengervehicle sales.Using relevant current projections from the SBTi SDA Transporttool and adjusting for inclusion of Scope 1 and 2 manufacturingemissions and U.S. light truck sales, JPMorgan Chase has set a

2030 target of 92.3 g CO2e/km for our Auto Manufacturing sectorportfolio, representing a 41% reduction from our 2019 baseline of157.8 g CO2e/km. Note that we estimate this baseline to be slightlyhigher than the current global average for the industry, reflectingJPMorgan Chase’s greater exposure to car and light truck sales inthe U.S., where fuel economies and regulations currently lag thoseof other major markets. This means that our target entails a steeperdecline to achieve 2030 Paris alignment than if we started from abaseline more consistent with the global average.Historically, the B2DS has been updated every three years as partof IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives report. In its most recentupdate (2020) IEA discontinued the B2DS scenario in favor of theSDS scenario. As with its other sector methodologies based on theSDS scenario, we will review the new IEA projections and assess theappropriateness of recalibrating its adopted benchmark targets.

4.5. Data Sources and Considerations

To estimate sales-weighted carbon intensity values for eachcompany in JPMorgan Chase’s Auto Manufacturing sector portfolio,we use the approach developed by the Transition Pathway Initiative(TPI) for deriving g CO2/km from reported average miles per gallon(MPG), with small modifications to include U.S. light truck sales andScope 1 and 2 manufacturing emissions.We estimate the carbon intensity for U.S. light trucks using TPI’smethodology and the company’s average fuel economy for lighttrucks reported by the NHTSA. This is combined with the company’sTPI-reported value for global cars on a sales-weighted basis.Finally, Scope 1 and 2 emissions, amortized over the expected life ofmanufactured vehicles, are added to Scope 3 intensity to derive thecompany’s combined g CO2e/km value.For a very small proportion of companies, certain pieces of datarequired for the metric calculation may not be available every year.In such cases, JPMorgan Chase will seek to address any gaps using adefined data waterfall approach that may include company-disclosedfigures, provided they are verified and prepared in line with the TPImethodology. Failing that, we use proxy values equivalent to the 75thpercentile of the available data for other portfolio companies.Finally, it should be noted that calculations for our AutoManufacturing sector portfolio will generally be subject to a two tothree-year data lag. This is due to a significant lag in reporting of

certified model year fuel economy and sales values due to typicallylong sales cycles (i.e., up to 22 months spanning three calendaryears) for individual model years in the U.S. This means that thelast available metric based on fully verified data is as of 2017, and tocalculate our 2018 portfolio value we rely on NHTSA’s preliminarymid-model year report that is subject to change. The 2019 metric isan extrapolation based on past performance and will be restated,along with 2018, when NHTSA verified data is published.As with the Oil \& Gas sector described above, the methodologycurrently allows all types of company-implemented carbon removals— including carbon capture, use and storage (CCS/CCUS), directair capture and nature-based solutions — to be credited againstcompany Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions, provided that they areproperly attributed according to standard GHG accounting protocols.The methodology also allows crediting of reductions associated withthird-party carbon removals projects that have been validated andregistered on an eligible platform. At this time, the methodologydoes not give credit for other company-implemented or third-partyreduction projects, such as for avoided emissions. We recognizethat this is an evolving space and remain committed to consideringother crediting mechanisms as technology and protocols evolves.Renewable energy credits (RECs) can be applied against Scope 2emissions from purchased electricity used in auto production.



22Carbon CompassSM : Paris-Aligned Financing Commitment Methodology

Our Carbon Compass methodology establishes a strong foundation for implementation of JPMorgan Chase’s Paris-aligned financing commitment, including clear frameworks for how we will measure progress and engage withclients in key sectors, beginning with Oil \& Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing sectors. We believe ourapproach reflects the ambition, thoughtfulness and rigor that our clients and other stakeholders expect from us,and which will be crucial as we work together to help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Yet, theseare just the first steps of the longer journey that our Paris-aligned financing commitment represents.

We will engage with and provide annual updates to our stakeholders on the implementation of our commitment.Over time as scenarios and data improve, technology develops and we engage more with clients, we will look atwhat it would take to enhance our targets to bring them in line with net-zero by 2050. Additionally, we will continueto evaluate the appropriateness and technical feasibility of expanding our commitment to other sectors.

We understand the urgency and the scale of the climate challenge. Our Paris-aligned financing commitment,combined with a number of other strategic efforts across our business, is a key step forward. We look forward tobuilding on it and doing our part to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
