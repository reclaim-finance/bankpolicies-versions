1. Our lead entity HSBC Global Asset Management Ltd is a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Managers

initiative. It has an interim target of reducing Scope 1 and 2 financed emissions intensity by 58%

between 2019 and 2030 for its in scope assets under management (AUM), consisting of listed

equities and corporate fixed income managed within its major investment hubs. As of 31 December

2019, in scope assets amounted to $193.9bn, equating to 38% of global AUM. Its targets remain

subject to consultation with stakeholders including investors and fund boards on whose behalf it

manages the assets. The 58% target is based on assumptions for financial markets and other data,

including the IEA Net Zero emissions by 2050 scenario and its underlying activity growth

assumptions. Carbon emissions intensity is measured as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per

million USD invested (tCO2e/M$ invested), where emissions are scaled by enterprise values including

cash. Scope 1 emissions are from sources that are owned or controlled by investee companies;

Scope 2 emissions are from the use of energy purchased by investee companies. Our interim target

does not cover Scope 3 emissions, which are all other indirect emissions from across investee

companies’ value chains. HSBC Asset Management is closely following the review that the NZAM

Initiative has launched on the future of the initiative.

We recognise climate change as a significant challenge facing our

clients in their investments.

For that reason, we have made a strategic corporate commitment to

the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM).

As signatories to this initiative, we have committed to work in

partnership with our clients on decarbonisation goals, consistent

with an ambition to reach net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner

across all assets under management.

In line with the Net Zero Asset Managers commitment, we have set

a 2030 interim target to reduce the Scope 1 and 2 emissions

intensity of 38 per cent of our assets by 58 per cent compared with

20191.

We have chosen the Net Zero Investment Framework as a

methodology for our interim target. We are following the

International Energy Agency Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario

(the IEA Net Zero Scenario).

We recognise the need for the net zero transition to be stable, fair,

and supportive of those communities most impacted. We have

signed the Statement of Investor Commitment to Support a Just

Transition on Climate Change.

We need to ensure that decarbonisation and energy security go

hand-in-hand, and also ensure that communities are not left behind.

This policy forms part of our Net Zero Asset Managers commitment.

It is developed in support of HSBC Group’s net zero ambition and is

aligned with the HSBC Energy Policy. It complements our own

Thermal Coal Policy2 as updated from time to time.

This policy is subject to our legal and regulatory obligations to

clients.



Our Net Zero Objective

PUBLIC



2



A vibrant energy sector fuels the global economy. We understand

society’s reliance upon energy and the need for safe, secure and

sustainable energy at an affordable price.

Energy is also at the heart of the transition to net zero. As the

principal agent in the use of fossil fuels, the energy sector requires a

significant transition to switch from reliance upon fossil fuels to a

sustainable energy system. It is integral to efforts to drive down the

carbon intensity of energy use and accelerate investment in clean

fuels, renewables and electrification.

The energy transition is a systemic change for the economy,

bringing investment risk for our clients but also significant

investment opportunities as new infrastructure is built and

technologies emerge.

Our approach to the energy sector is driven by our analysis of the

investment impact of these risks and opportunities, informing our

Net Zero Objective, and based upon our clients’ investment interest.

We prioritise engagement as the best means of meeting investment

objectives and encouraging energy issuers in their transition.

We recognise that fossil fuels, especially natural gas, have a role to

play in the transition, even though that role will continue to

diminish. The IEA Net Zero Scenario highlights that an orderly

transition requires continued financing and investment in existing oil

and gas fields to maintain the necessary output, with 2020

financing levels maintained through to 2030 and declining

thereafter. It projects oil and gas demand falling by around 4 per

cent a year on average between 2020 and 2050 and no new oil or

gas fields needed beyond those already approved for development.

At the same time, a significant increase is required in global

investment in the clean technologies and infrastructure that can

help transform future energy supply and demand.

Our 2050 net zero ambition and 2030 interim emission reduction

target mean that we also focus on the contribution of issuers’

greenhouse gas emissions to the total emissions of our assets under

management.

We believe that the energy transition should deliver a significant

reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from energy sector issuers

held in our portfolios.

PUBLIC



1. In line with Net Zero Investment Framework recommendations, we engage with and assess transition plans

of listed issuers responsible for around 70 per cent of relevant emissions. We undertake engagement and

assessment of the oil \& gas and power \& utilities issuers in this group.



Companies with reliance upon fossil fuels need robust plans for their path through the transition to

net zero. We are working to develop our understanding of the transition plans of energy and other

issuers held in our portfolios and to encourage the development of these plans. Our net zero

commitment means that, over time, we aim to evaluate the emissions and transition plans of all

significant energy issuers within our portfolios, as well as other key sectors. Where these fall short,

we will engage and where necessary escalate our actions.

Under our Thermal Coal policy, we assess coal-exposed issuers’ transition plans. We also assess the

transition plans of oil \& gas and power \& utilities issuers.



3. These aspects of the transition inform the engagement objectives we set for

issuers, as well as our assessment of progress towards meeting our 2030

interim emissions reduction target and Net Zero Objective.



4. Where issuer transition plans fall short of our expectations following

engagement and there has not been adequate progress in meeting

engagement objectives, we will consider escalation of our

engagement as set out in our Stewardship Plan3. These insights also

inform our analysis of the sustainability of investments. We are likely

over time to reduce investment exposure to issuers whose transition

plans are inconsistent with our net zero objective and 2030 interim

emissions reduction target.



5. Our voting approach for oil \& gas and utilities issuers reflects our

view that the board should be responsible for the company’s

climate change strategy and any shortfall in the management

oversight of relevant issues. We use the Transition Pathway

Initiative (TPI) 4 scores, in addition to other internal and external

research, to assess issuers’ progress with transition. This may

include votes against the re-election of the chair or relevant board

director of oil \& gas and utilities issuers.



2. We assess their transition plans, including aspects such as plans to reduce carbon exposure and

develop alternative energy sources, alignment of capital expenditure, timelines for transition, interim

emission reduction targets and quality of climate risk management disclosure and emissions

reporting. We include just transition elements in our assessment and consider the regional context

as we assess issuers’ alignment with the IEA Net Zero Scenario.



 For oil \& gas issuers in this group, we assess exposure to new field development identified as inconsistent

with the IEA Net Zero Scenario. We also consider issuer commitments related to reducing fugitive methane

emissions and elimination of venting and flaring unless absolutely necessary for safety reasons.



 For power \& utilities issuers in this group, we consider commitments on the abatement of emissions.



3. Please visit the page ‘Stewardship’ on our public website for more details on our Stewardship Plan.

4. The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) assesses companies on two dimensions based on publicly

available information: corporate climate governance and carbon emissions, and provides an overall

scoring from Level 0 (unaware) to 4 (strategic assessment). The TPI Centre online tool is publicly

available at the following link: https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/sectors

7. We will not undertake new direct investment in projects associated with the following activities (other than

where exempted – see glossary in Appendix below – p.7):

 new oil \& gas fields where the final investment decision was taken after 31 December 2021;

 ultra-deepwater offshore oil \& gas projects;

 shale oil projects;

overall transition plan to achieve abated power generation or intended to operate solely as a low capacity factor

‘peaker’ plant, shifting to net zero power over time (e.g. carbon capture and storage, green hydrogen, green

ammonia), to support the client’s overall transition to predominantly variable renewable production and net zero

power;

 new large dams or expansion of existing large dams inconsistent with the Hydropower Sustainability Standard or in

environmentally and socially critical areas;

 nuclear projects inconsistent with International Atomic Energy Agency standards or in environmentally and socially

critical areas;

 new biomass power plants in excess of 10 MW without sustainable biomass sources or in environmentally and

socially critical areas.



Our Alternatives business undertakes project financing investment in unlisted entities and applies

the following restrictions. These restrictions do not apply to listed issuers’ exposure to the activities

concerned.

8. We continue our active engagement with clients to inform and support their own net zero commitments.



6. Assessing issuers’ carbon emissions and intensity is an element of our Environmental, Social \& Governance

(ESG) research framework, which is part of the investment process of many of our active fundamental

investment funds.

We have introduced for our active fundamental sustainable named funds an exclusion of listed issuers whose

overall operations are substantially in unconventional oil and gas, subject to data availability and due

diligence.



Investment considerations \& restrictions

Our engagement with and assessment of listed issuers responsible

for around 70 per cent of relevant emissions is based upon all listed

equity and corporate fixed income under our direct investment

control and managed within our major investment hubs. It therefore

covers active fundamental, active systematic and passive holdings.

Our voting activity covers all equity holdings managed in our UK,

France, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, Malta and India offices –

whether active fundamental, active systematic or passive – over

which we have voting discretion, with commitments in this policy

subject to TPI coverage and our discretion to consider other factors.

Our voting records are publicly available online.

For exclusions of listed issuers whose overall operations are

substantially in unconventional oil and gas, we currently have

appropriate data related to arctic oil \& gas, oil sands and shale oil;

details are set out in fund prospectuses. We will review restrictions

on listed issues with substantial involvement in ultra-deepwater

offshore oil \& gas, extra heavy oil, and other environmentally and

socially critical areas over time.

Listed issuer and unlisted project financing investment restrictions

do not apply to certain portfolios where we do not have sole

discretion or to any legacy buy and hold investments.

Where we do not have full portfolio discretion, or board/equity

control such as joint ventures, independent director-controlled fund

boards and client segregated mandates, elements of this policy

which may result in investment restrictions or eventual divestment

are subject to client, fund director and regulatory approval.

Multi-asset or fund of fund strategies utilising third party, systematic

or passive funds may be unable to implement certain aspects of this

policy, with potential limited exposure to issuers that would

otherwise be excluded. Sustainable multi asset or fund of funds

strategies seek funds with aligned / similar restrictions where these

are available.

We shall review other asset classes in due course under our Net

Zero Asset Managers initiative commitments.

We use third party data providers to monitor issuers’ exposure to

certain activities and / or breaches of standards. Whilst we assess

providers as part of ongoing monitoring, it is not possible to

guarantee their accuracy, completeness, quality of judgement or

timeliness. We may set aside their data or scoring where our own

due diligence suggests that this may be inaccurate, incomplete or

disproportionate.

Existing and new client on-boarding requirements set out in the

HSBC Energy Policy are applied by HSBC Group where relevant as

part of its on-boarding process for HSBC Asset Management

clients.

Oversight of the application of this policy is part of our governance

and risk framework, which includes formal governance committees

at global and local business levels. Implementation may be led at

asset class level, supported by other investment and business

functions.

It will be reviewed at least annually, to consider changes in relevant

external factors (e.g. changes in the scientific assessment of climate

change impact, transition pathways and future risk or changes in

governmental or regulatory treatment). Reporting on overall

progress towards our Net Zero Asset Managers commitments will

reflect the impact of this policy alongside other factors.

This policy refers to particular energy-related activities, aligned with

those identified in the HSBC Energy Policy. Data concerning issuers’

exposure to particular activities are often not available on a

consistent basis to public or private market investors. Irrespective of

whether an energy-related activity is explicitly included in this

policy, we will seek to monitor the emissions contribution and

assess the transition plans – either directly or systematically – of

listed issuers held in our portfolios which may have exposure to

these activities.

plants may be required to complement variable wind and solar power across seasonal peaks

and to help ensure overall security of supply in the medium term. These plants run for relatively

few hours of the year and contribute only a small amount to overall emissions. Any new

‘peaker’ gas-fired power plants would be expected to achieve abated power generation.
