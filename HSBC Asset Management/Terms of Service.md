Energy policy



Today, we and many of our customers contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. We have a

strategy to reduce our own emissions and to develop solutions to help our clients invest

sustainably. For more information visit https://www.assetmanagement.hsbc.com/about-

us/net-zero

1Introduction



We recognise climate change as a significant challenge facing our clients in their

investments. Climate-related risks may have a material effect on the risk profile and

financial performance of investments over various investment time horizons.

This policy is developed in support of HSBC Group’s net zero ambition and is aligned with

the HSBC Energy Policy. It complements the HSBC Asset Management Thermal Coal

Policy1 as updated from time to time.



Energy transition

Energy is at the heart of the transition to net zero. The energy sector requires a significant

transition to switch from reliance upon fossil fuels to a sustainable energy system.

The energy transition is a systemic change for the economy, bringing investment risk for

our clients but also significant investment opportunities as new infrastructure is built and

technologies emerge.

Our approach to the energy sector is driven by our analysis of the investment impact of

these risks and opportunities based upon our clients’ investment interest.

We prioritise engagement as the best means of supporting energy issuers in their transition.

We recognise that fossil fuels, especially natural gas, have a role to play in the transition,

even though that role will continue to diminish.

At the same time, a significant increase is required in global investment in the clean

technologies and infrastructure that can help transform future energy supply and demand.

Listed issuers



Notes:

2\. Covers listed equity and corporate fixed income issuers managed in our major investment hubs.

3\. Please visit the page ‘Stewardship’ on our public website for more details on our Stewardship Plan.



1\. We aim to engage with and assess transition plans of listed issuers2 responsible for around 70 per cent of

relevant emissions. We undertake engagement and assessment of the oil \& gas and power \& utilities issuers in

this group. Aspects of the transition plan assessments will inform the engagement objectives we set for issuers.



2\. Where issuer transition plans fall short of our expectations following engagement and there has not been

adequate progress in meeting engagement objectives, we will consider escalation of our engagement as set out

in our Stewardship Plan3. We are likely over time to reduce investment exposure to issuers whose transition

plans are inconsistent with a net zero objective, for active fundamental managed funds.



3\. Our voting approach for oil \& gas and power \& utilities issuers reflects our view that the board should be

responsible for the company’s climate change strategy and any shortfall in the management oversight of relevant

issues. This may include votes against the re-election of a relevant board director of oil \& gas and power \&

utilities issuers.



Transition plan engagement and assessment



Under our Thermal Coal policy, we assess coal-exposed issuers’ transition plans. We

also assess the transition plans of oil \& gas and power \& utilities issuers.



4\. We have introduced for our ESG and/or sustainable named active fundamental strategies an exclusion of listed

issuers whose overall operations are substantially in Arctic oil \& gas, oil sands, and shale oil, subject to data

availability and due diligence.



Investment considerations \& restrictions



Unlisted project financing



5\. We will not undertake new direct investment in projects associated with the following activities (in line with

our internal guidelines):



 new oil \& gas fields where the government permitting (or equivalent) for development of the specific field

was taken after 31 December 2021;



 shale oil projects;



 extra heavy oil projects;



 oil \& gas projects in environmentally and socially critical areas;



 infrastructure whose primary use is in conjunction with the above activities;



Investment restrictions



Our Alternatives business undertakes project financing investment in unlisted entities

and applies the following restrictions. These restrictions do not apply to listed issuers’

exposure to the activities concerned.

3Unlisted project financing



 hydrogen produced using any technology pathway resulting in a carbon intensity exceeding thresholds set

by HSBC that take into consideration national or regional carbon intensity standards, as updated from time

to time;



 new oil-fired power plants;



 new large dams or expansion of existing large dams inconsistent with the Hydropower Sustainability

Standard or in environmentally and socially critical areas;



 nuclear projects inconsistent with International Atomic Energy Agency standards or in environmentally and

socially critical areas;



 new biomass power plants in excess of 10 megawatt (MW) without sustainable biomass sources or in

environmentally and socially critical areas.



6\. Enhanced Due diligence will be required for the following activities to be investable:



 Offshore oil \& gas projects where the depth exceeds 2000m;



 New (or converted) gas fired power plants, conversion of existing coal to gas fired power plants, or

conversion of existing oil to gas fired power plants;



Investment restrictions (continued)



Clients



7\. We continue to discuss with our clients how we can support them in their own climate objectives, where

relevant.

4Application



The application of this policy remains subject to compliance with local laws and regulations.



This policy will be reviewed at least annually. We will report annually on HSBC Asset Management’s progress

on programmes and policies related to HSBC Group’s Net Zero 2050 target.



Where we do not have full portfolio discretion, or board/equity control, elements of this policy which may result

in investment restrictions or eventual divestment are subject to client, fund director and regulatory approval.

This will include joint ventures, independent director-controlled fund boards and client segregated mandates.

This policy does not cover India as an independent director-controlled entity, and mainland China domestic

funds managed via our joint-ventures due to differing national timelines and local governance decisions.



Multi-asset or fund of fund strategies utilising third party, systematic or passive funds may be unable to

implement certain aspects of this policy. This might mean such funds have potential exposure to issuers that

would otherwise be excluded. ESG and sustainable multi asset or fund of funds strategies seek funds with

aligned / similar restrictions where these are available.



Our engagement with and assessment of listed issuers responsible for around 70 per cent of relevant emissions

is based upon all listed equity and corporate fixed income under our direct investment control and managed

within our major investment hubs. It therefore covers active fundamental, active systematic and passive

holdings.



Listed issuer and unlisted project financing investment restrictions do not apply to certain portfolios where we

do not have sole discretion or to any legacy buy and hold investments.



We use third party data providers to monitor issuers’ exposure to certain activities and / or breaches of

standards. Whilst we assess providers as part of ongoing monitoring, it is not possible to guarantee their

accuracy, completeness, quality of judgement or timeliness. We may set aside their data or scoring where our

own due diligence suggests that this may be inaccurate, incomplete or disproportionate.



HSBC's ESG and sustainable Investing strategies include impact funds with an ESG or Sustainable objective,

thematic funds that seek to invest in ESG or sustainable trends, and strategies that seek to mitigate ESG risks

by investing assets with higher ESG performance and/or exclusions of those that are lower ESG performing.

Considerations across strategies can include but are not limited to climate/net-zero and/or UN Sustainable

Development Goals. For the avoidance of doubt, assets invested pursuant to the ESG and sustainable Investing

strategies do not necessarily qualify as "sustainable investments" as defined by SFDR or other relevant

regulations. The HSBC ESG and sustainable Investing Framework is an HSBC internal classification framework

used to establish ESG and sustainable Investing standards and promote consistency across asset classes and

business lines where relevant, and should not be relied on to assess the sustainability characteristics of any

given product.



Oversight of the application of this policy is part of our governance and risk framework. Adoption of this

policy includes formal governance committees at global and local business levels. Implementation may

be led at asset class level, supported by other investment and business functions.

S



Activities where the primary purpose, or value proposition, is the exploration, development and production of shale

oil (as opposed to natural gas liquids (NGLs) and gas).



Note: When drilling for shale oil, shale gas is often produced as a by-product and vice versa. Shale gas productions

often have some oil and condensate content which may also get monetised but are not the primary focus of the

operations, as gas is the business primary focus/revenue generator.



Shale oil



Sustainable biomass refers to biomass that:



• has a low lifecycle carbon footprint that considers the opportunity cost of the land as well as the timing of carbon

sequestration and carbon release specific to each form of biomass and its use;

• the principles of the waste management hierarchy are considered and any waste biomass can be classified as

suitable for energy recovery in the waste management hierarchy; and

• is produced without triggering any destructive land use change (in particular minimising deforestation) and avoids

competition with other key land uses (such as food production).
